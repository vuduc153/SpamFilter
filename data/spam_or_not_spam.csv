"My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.

Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.

While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best ""toast"" I've ever had.

Anyway, I can't wait to go back!",0
"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.

In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!

We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.",0
love the gyro plate. Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection :),0
"Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.

The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.

The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!",0
"General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail, but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and I'd be surprised if you don't walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... ""Mistakes are inevitable, it's how we recover from them that is important""!!!

Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. You've got a customer for life!! .......... :^)",0
"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",0
"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.

This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!

It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!

As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.",0
"Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight. And for this, I thank you, Phoenix.

My brief layover was pleasant as the employees were kind and the flight was on time.  Hopefully, next time I can grace Phoenix with my presence for a little while longer.",0
"Definitely come for Happy hour! Prices are amazing, sake bombers for $3...Great atmosphere and wait staff was incredibly nice and right on to all of our needs, didn't have to ask for a thing They were always spot on...Place gets crowded in the evening especially if you plan on sitting outside. I only wish there were one in Apollo Beach or Brandon!",0
Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.,0
"The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be.  Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream.

Here's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap.  The flavor permutations are basically endless.  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.  It was marvelous.",0
Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.,0
"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.  

The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.",0
"Good tattoo shop. Clean space, multiple artists to choose from and books of their work are available for you to look though and decide who's style most mirrors what you're looking for. I chose Jet to do a cover-up for me and he worked with me on the design and our ideas and communication flowed very well. He's a very personable guy, is friendly and keeps the conversation going while he's working on you, and he doesn't dick around (read: He starts to work and continues until the job is done). He's very professional and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft.",0
"I'm 2 weeks new to Phoenix. I looked up Irish bars in town and found Rosie's. The decor and ambience was outstanding. I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! 

The basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.


All the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming. I am sure I will see a bunch (or all) of them again and I look forward to that!",0
"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying ""x large pizza and large salad only 23$"". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. 

To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. 

And your salads are severely overpriced 

Won't go back unless I'm desperate.",0
"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!

Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are ""seasoned"" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.

My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.

It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.",0
"okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!",0
"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. 

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. 

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"". 

We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? 
We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. 

My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.

I'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.",0
"They've gotten better and better for me in the time since this review was written. 

My last contact with them was a few days ago when I was having trouble redeeming some Groupons on their website. I called customer service and after waiting a few minutes I spoke with a rep who cheerfully booked four separate flights for me, patiently and manually entering my Groupon info for each one.

I think the acquisition by Republic has helped them overall. After Republic took over the in-flight cookies started. It still tends to suck if you aren't Ascent club (like just about any budget-centric airline does), but once you get there it's a good value. When I've had to fly Southwest or USAir I've been disappointed in comparison.",0
"DVAP....

You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history. 

The service is great, it appears to be family run. 

The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. 

I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. 

They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go.",0
This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =),0
"first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!",0
"U can go there n check the car out. If u wanna buy 1 there? That's wrong move! If u even want a car service from there? U made a biggest mistake of ur life!! I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service, guess what? They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now. If without fixing the problem. Might bring some serious accident. Then she did what they said. 4 brand new tires, timing belt, 4 new brake pads. U know why's the worst? All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!! What a trashy dealer is that? People, better off go somewhere!",0
"I love this place! I have been coming here for ages.
My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!",0
"This place is great.  A nice little ole' fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.

The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!

Anyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!",0
"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. 
I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. 
Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!",0
"Not that my review will mean much given the more in-depth reviewers but I will chime in nonetheless...

I can really only review one dish, the #3 lunch special, Yellow Curry Chicken. I don't know what the authentic name for it is, Kang Karee something or other. It's so tasty that the first time I had it I knew I'd never branch out. Good lunch spot if you work around downtown. Not the quickest service all the time and can get busy during lunch, but always consistently good. Fairly dim inside, a good place to forget about the sun on a summer day.",0
"Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.",0
"Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous ""bitch fizz"" (ciders, etc.) and cocktails.  Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu.  I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception.",0
"Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.

That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.

I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.",0
Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.,0
"Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!

TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.",0
I went here again when I got back to Phoenix after being gone for six months. This is one of my mom's favorite places to eat and I can understand why. The ravioli and the miso soup are so delicious! The wine was ok and I would recommend one of their elixirs over an alcohol beverage. Still a pretty delicious place to go in Phoenix.,0
"There's two ways to look at this place. One is getting quality food at a good price. The other is getting a lot of food for a cheap price. I prefer the former but those who prefer the latter won't agree with my review.

I thought the scramble I had was okay but nothing fantastic. I definitely didn't care for the biscuits. The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance... I would rather have something with more character but I'm glad I tried this place out.",0
"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.
Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.
If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",0
"They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded ""hover over a table to get a seat"" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded ""Panera Bread"" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a ""mass produced"" feeling and taste.

The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.

I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  

The ""side of pancakes"" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  

They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.

Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!",0
"Very clean and well thought out floor plans, nice to have a friendly staff with smiling faces. Best Target I have been to in a while.",0
"This Mexican food is very simple, slightly bland, but fairly fresh. The chicken is chopped up into tofu-looking squares. But I was satisfied with the food, which was fairly healthy Mexican food as Mexican food goes. The staff is quite polite. I met some cool people hanging out there while I sat outside.",0
"Decor  functional 
Staff friendly and are really kind to our toddler
food rocks  within my  limited range of  red and yellow curries ( so much so they suggested I try something else, hey it's not my fault these are so good that I didn't want to risk anything lesser. 

Prices are a bargain for entrees,  spice is there, they really get the request to make it very very hot.   This is probably the best bargain  in North Phoenix for  spice hounds",0
"This Place just opened up next to the salon I work in. AMAZING! They hit the ground running, 

It's a deli style, where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. I had the Grayhawk Turkey Club and the turkey was great! No packaged crap here. It was thick sliced and probably rotisserie. For the side I had sweet potato tater tots. DELISH! The have regular fries, sweet fries, tater tots, onion rings, etc. 

Great looking salads, Chicago-style dogs, gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese. 

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price. It's great for dinner, but a little steep for a work day lunch.",0
"I really really like Frances.  I love most of the clothes in there, but I can never have them because I can't afford it.  The store in general is pretty cool, there are lots of neat things in here from stationery to clothes to jewelry to baby stuff to dog stuff to vintage stuff.  There is a lot of stuff here.  It's all quite pricey though.  The sales they have every now and then are sorta okay, but still break the bank if you buy anything.  Overall they carry good quality products and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  I can't hate on a place too bad just because I can't afford it.",0
"Solid food, great device, and casual environment.  They will not leave you hungry.  Overall, it's really good.",0
"my son really enjoys islands, great food, casual kid freindly atmoshpere we go here quite a lot and seem to keep coming back",0
"I was seated at the bar. A very nice young man was working the bar an provided good conversation.

I was offered a DELICIOUS chicken, bacon, bleu cheese amuse. Yum!

I ordered a pine nut pesto pizza, which wad delivered by the chef! :)

The crust was perfect! Thick enough for structure and substance, but thin enough to ""hide"" behind the flavors of tomato and pine nut pesto.
The cheese was also just right.

Delicious!

I also had the chicken panini, which was fantastic! The bread was a bit hard, but I think I was too busy talking and let it sit too long.

All in all I'd definitely recommend L'Academie if you're in that area of Scottsdale.",0
"Everything was nice. The ice cream was delicious, no overwhelming alcohol taste & an interesting variety of flavors. Service was fine, place was clean. I'll go back, but only because I have a killer sweet tooth and they're in the neighborhood.",0
"(Un)fortunately for me, lux is close to my house.  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.  The coffee and pastries are amazing.  They always play really great music too!",0
"After watching her win on Cupcake Wars I was determined to find this place (It's very well hidden)and sample the cupcakes.  I have to say I was not impressed; i make better cupcakes on my own.  More creative and not so sweet you'll go into a diabetic coma.  i did have a California BLT as well and it was a good sandwich although the bread was a little too toasted for my liking.  The staff was friendly, the ambiance was very pleasant and it was clean.  But the cupcakes...really not all that.  Sorry....",0
Good for an easy and leisurely business lunch or outing with the girls.  The market downstairs is great for takeout and a great selection of bakery treats.,0
"After my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, I got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  I thought to myself, ""how nice"", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.

So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a ""different"" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.",0
"Cliff notes
- Cheap: $1-2/plate
- Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor
- Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lol

This place is definitely good for what it is, ""it"" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to ""reduce costs"" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.

On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). 

I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).

For those claiming to be ""left to fend for themselves"" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called ""the menu"" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as ""descriptions"" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAF

And the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!",0
"Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.  

Did you catch that?

DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!",0
"I have no idea whether there is a Japanese community in this part of town, but New Tokyo would suit one well.  It's rather small, but they have a wide selection of Japanese, snacks, beverages (including my new fave beer, Asahi Black), refrigerated items, staples, etc.  

This is not an Asian market, it's specifically Japanese, so don't expect more than a few crossover items like kimchi.  That being said, sometimes it's good to specialize.  It lets them carry more variety of Japanese products.

The cashier was very friendly when I finally stopped loading my basket long enough to check out.  Like the first reviewer, I loaded up with snacks for the hotel room...along with a six-pack of Asahi Black, of course.  Oh, one more important factor...the prices were quite reasonable, in line with most ethnic market imports...maybe even a bit cheaper than usual.",0
"We got passes for the preview of Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol).  We enjoyed the movie a lot.  The theater itself is fine.  The chairs don't move, and you can't raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.  

They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.  It wasn't bad, but given my other IMAX experiences I did notice it.",0
"Alright, I have been away from Yelp for quite some time, and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...

Chicken and Waffles.  Yes, chicken and M'Fin waffles.  

In the ghetto?  Check
Has sweet tea?  Check
Has no-nonsense, quick service?  Check
Ridiculously long wait?  Check
Best thing that I have eaten in the last year?  Check

I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.

If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...",0
"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.",0
"I have to add to Andrew's review.....

I just can't believe the things that happened!!

Yes the app was good.  The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!

But the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!

When we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.

I was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  
I ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!

When we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.

When she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.",0
"This would most certainly be ""my"" coffee shop if I hadn't already established myself as a regular at another local shop. This brand-new, independent coffee shop has spent the money to look really nice (it even has a fountain inside!).

But what money can't buy is community and unfortunately this shop doesn't seem to have much of that. Granted, building community takes time and/or energy. For their sake, I really really hope it works out in the long-run.",0
No matter what I order I know it will be tasty. Maizie's have a lot to choose from which can be a little overwhelming for me. I love their wait staff everyone is always friendly. When I am in Maizie's I feel like I am in a neighborhood hang out.,0
"This restaurant is incredible, and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful, though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven, and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.

I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.

The owner, Jon, is helpful, friendly, and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations, and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page.",0
"One of the spot my coworkers and I go to for lunch. We usually try to get there before 11am (weekdays) to beat the rush from all the Corporate places near the MetroCenter.  

The deli sandwiches are good.  I usually stick to getting the Amy's turkey-O.  If you plan on substituting a side, make sure you tell them because the cashiers don't normally ask and you'll be stuck with chips.  The salad bar here is very decent for the price.  

Don't forget to get ice cream on the way out!",0
"I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except ""Hold on"". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked ""what do you want?"" Serious help is needed there!
 If you work in the area of ""customer service"" I think you should have some.",0
"If I could give 4 stars for atmosphere and 3 stars for food I would.

With all the hype of getting a Margaritaville I guess was expecting a little more in the way of Margaritas and cheeseburgers. But I was underwhelmed with both. You can get a much better burger next door at Yardhouse and a much better selection of Margaritas from Salty Senorita. With that aside this place is quite the spectacle. It has 2 stories, a stage, fishing boat booths, and every other piece of decor that a Parrothead could love. TV's broadcast Jimmy himself rocking out and some odd montages of Parrothead outings. Live music is offered here several nights of the week and they offer 2-3 bar areas. If defiantly won't become part of the regular rotation but from time to time we might wonder in looking for our lost shaker of salt.",0
"It is romantic here even if you are with just friends. The waitress kneels at the couch to speak with you, pour your wine, bring your check...I love that...its so 5 star and respectful. Our waitress was so friendly and I was on cloud 9 because the whole ambience made my evening so nice. I love the darkness of it, its all so exotic and relaxing there especially with all the coves and different areas to be seated. Apparently you have to put your name down if you want a table for certain as it seems to be packed anytime I have been there. We needed one more bar stool-we had no reservation and the waiter actually went ""out to the storage"" to get us one. Impressive!",0
Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!,0
"Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said ""they try the best they can""  hmmmmmm isn't this a ""fish"" restaurant? 
They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back.",0
"This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online, Tempe and Casa Grande.   The wonderful children's and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people.",0
"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.",0
"The best sweet and sour soup ever!  Food is delicious and favorable.  Delivery is pretty good, nice people.",0
"I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colors/design.  Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs.  I knew I wanted a booklet-style, but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed!  I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done - not just wedding invitations.  Thomas and his crew are stellar!!",0
"Every now and then my Vietnamese side craves for PHO...are you surprised!?  Noodle Ranch is my local Pho joint.  I can literally walk to this place :)  Okay, the Pho Tai is great here....I got the combination once and it wasn't as good.  I love the decor here lots and lots of old photos of Vietnam.  Service is always good here and I've been here when their busy and when it's slow.  If you need a Pho fix I would definitely recommend this place!",0
"Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. 

La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person! 

I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.",0
"This is your typical Buffalo Exchange. I've been to others in San Francisco and San Diego, and they're all pretty much the same. Yes, they're super picky brand name whores about what they buy from you, but it means that there are some really great items for a much smaller price tag. I've gotten dresses that people always compliment and things that I've bought on impluse because I thought it was a great buy, and wore once. 

The building this one is located in leaves a lot to be desired, but  there are good buys inside. I walked away with a great pair of skinny jeans, a cute top, and a super comfy dress for under $50 =).",0
"Though perhaps not the place you may pick for a special brunch with champagne and chocolate brioche French toast (a signature breakfast at the Sofitel Philadelphia), the Good Egg is my choice for neighborhood breakfast that offers consistent service and food in a comfortable atmosphere.

No matter how busy the restaurant becomes, and on Sunday it is packed,  the staff is always friendly and welcoming. You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant!

The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of ""fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas... 

We always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix.

After you have been here a few times you feel like part of the family and with their frequent dinner program they offer even more incentive to return.",0
"I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone, this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.

The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.

The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )",0
"Great Southwestern restaurant.  The food is incredible, especially the stacked enchiladas.  Normally I do not eat heavy foods, but this was way too good to pass up.  The chips and salsa were very tasty as well.

Service was very friendly and timely.  The interior is pedestrian at best, but still a pleasant environment.",0
"Went back to AB a few weekends ago, again for brunch, with a large group.  I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.",0
"Great prices, great food. The staff is very friendly... I'll definitely be coming back here for lunch on a more regular basis. I had the kung pao, and the portions were incredible for the $5 I paid. 

Not mind blowing, but better than most Chinese places I've been to in the Valley.",0
Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!,0
"This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing, just wandering how busy its goona be in there ??? little worried, can any one reply me ??",0
"The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. 

I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.


So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:

*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.

*Spicy Buffalo ""Wings"": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the ""wings"". This dish is a must try!!

*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.

*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!

Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.


Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving ""meat"" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  

Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.",0
"Rokerij is worth the hype. We popped in last week for a late bite and left super happy. We scored a few seats at the bar, the place was SUPER crowded (which is a good sign on a Wednesday). I started with a beer called Banana Bread, which was awesome. Wifey had a glass of wine, but I can't remember what it was. We couldn't decide on what we wnated so we ended up splitting the entree of Blackened Salmon with Apple/Chipotle chutney and some potatoes. We also got three of the small Plates: mini reuben, crispy calamari and cilantro rubbed grilled shrimp. All the food was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries. The calamari was cooked perfectly, the shrimp were awesome (although the bed of rice it came on was meh), and the mini reubens were great as well. I was super excited to try it, and it delivered. Can't wait to go back!",0
"Beer...or Yoga?

Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.

Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.

Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  

That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.

As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). 

So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.

I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. 

Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending: 

NAMASTE!",0
"Great hotel in Central Phoenix for a stay-cation, but not necessarily a place to stay out of town and without a car. Not much around the area, and unless you're familiar with downtown, I would rather have a guest stay in Old Town Scottsdale, etc. BUT if you do stay here, it's awesome. Great boutique rooms. Awesome pool that's happening in the summer. A GREAT rooftop patio bar, and a very very busy lobby with Gallo Blanco attached. A great place to stay, but have a car!",0
"really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.",0
"Great place to have a meal with family, can be a little on the loud side cause ita always a busy place, recomend calling ahead and getting name put on waiting list, reservations party of six or more only price range moderate, but well worth it",0
"Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around. 

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.
 I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.

If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.

The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :) 

Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining. 

you will not be disappointed.",0
"I was only able to play the front 9; my wrist was hurting too much to finish, which is a big deal because I live in IL, and was returning from LA and stopped here specifically to play the TPC. Oh well.

I was a single, and got paired with another. The course was pretty open, but we took our time and enjoyed the round. The front nine, although rarely shown on TV, is quite nice. Definitely challenging enough, and I didn't even play the back tees.

It was fairly easy to get on, the bar had pretty good food for a clubhouse, and the staff were very helpful. Definitely recommend the TPC.",0
"I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!",0
"I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high, because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade, ran out of water, by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20% of the vendors were out of food, and by the time I ate my way through some, everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I don't think so.  

And when I mentioned it to ""the person in charge"", he was patronizing, invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well, I'm your consumer, big guy.  

Sorry, Devoured, wish it could have been better. 

What food I did try, was pretty good.",0
"The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...

Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...

I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)",0
"So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.

Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between.",0
This is a little hockey dive-bar located in the Arcadia area.  TV screens hang above the bar & as you look behind the bar you can see the hockey rink and players.  Enternaining as the other review said.  I had Dunkel Hefeweisen and my girlfriend had a Corona.  Good times as a group of kids played Rock Band and sang off-key Nirvana covers.  I like this little hidden place.  Just be prepared - it's your average little bar for the average Joe guy.,0
"Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the ""express dozen"" through the drive thru, and the kids didn't want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted.

The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for 2 donuts when you get a long john. :-(",0
"I grew up on Empanadas in Panama and I have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the U.S.. today I found them! 

A perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced. Usually Empanadas are bland and soggy. They did a great job on these.

I usually don't like rice, but the rice and black beans were wonderful. 

Service was great! I'll be back!",0
Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced.,0
"Had dinner and brunch, not on the same day...the dinner was good, although I thought the mandala masala could have used more flavor.  Brunch was great, tried 2 different tofu scrambles and both were very good.  Service is...let's say uninterested -- it's hard to be burdened with angst and chipper.",0
This is a very interesting place.  Don't go here thinking it will be classy.,0
"I LOVE Chic Nails!

I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were ""too busy"" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since. 

The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!

P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)",0
"After the Padres Spring Training game, we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!",0
"I have to admit that I find myself thinking that I like mine tall dark and Russian. 

 It's nice to have a coffee shop near by that's not Starbucks, has good coffee and reasonable prices.  So far I just stick with the house brew (which is smooth and not too bitter yet not too sweet) since the fancy coffee drinks usually have many calories that I do not need!  I have tried the blueberry muffin-quite yummy as well as the chocolate chip cookies- delicious.  The cafe is attached to The Great Indoors so you can people watch, browse thru design books or take a leisurely stroll through the design center.  It's a great way to unwind or perk up on your choice of caffeinated beverage.",0
"Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices. Love it!",0
"Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.",0
"OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and it's not just because we've been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.
As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card ""holidays"".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for ""corking fees"", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.
Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.",0
Great food and awesome service! Even better that the Chef came out and personally checked on our experience. I will be back for more delicious BBQ,0
"See the huge sign outside that says $2.50? Yeah, that's for shirts only. I was caught off guard when I brought in my skirt and got nailed for about $3.79. As I sadly handed over my $5 bill, the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside. No kidding. I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Ave.--who does a fine job in half the pickup time--for the ""advertised"" fake price here. Trying to make the best of it,  I told the lady at least I'd learned they had an onsite alteration service, and maybe that was worth a buck. UH OH. Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shore-type chick at the counter, and was told I owed another $3.79. I flat-out refused to pay twice. She screamed at me, chased me to my car, wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting. Ni-i-i-ice.",0
"After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's, my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance, twinkly lights in the courtyard, live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix. 

If you live in Phoenix, you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back.",0
"As Target's go this one is standard fare. That consistency is part of their brand recognition. However, as a part of the Up-Scale Desert Ridge Shopping Center, I'd expect a bit more than a Standard Target. Don't they have some sort of a Flagship Target?

Also traffic and parking can be atrocious at Desert Ridge. I drive to Target's and WalMart's much further from my house because the round trip time is less when I don't have to negotiate the teen packed Desert Ridge lot. Probably safer too.",0
"It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for. 

If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.",0
"Sacks is a different kind of sandwich shop. They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed. 

Oh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant.",0
This is my first time back in years. It will be my last. I was in the bar area for lunch it was almost 1hour 25 min before I could get out. Ten min before my drink order and almost as long before food order. A secound drink forget it. Guy next to me walked out.,0
"As mentioned earlier, the best thing about this place is the super cheap, but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish, rice, salad, and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough, you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special, but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.

As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!",0

"Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  

My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  

Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.  

Two thumbs way down.",0
Returned Sunday afternoon and was  pleasantly suprised. Happy Hour is 7 days a week 3-7 pm   ,0
"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food was amazing,who cares if it's  chain restaurant.
      We had tried to go the night before but they were packd so we made a reservation for the next night.It was really busy when we go there but we were seated immediately.Our server was really nice and very helpful when we told him we had never been there before.
           We ordered the fried alligator app,and loved every bite of it.I had the filet mignon and rock lobster tail.The steak was cooked perfectly and was a good size for the price.I'm not usually a huge fan of lobster but wanted to give it a try,Pappadeux has changed my opinion about lobster,the meat  came right out of the tail.It was buttery andjust plain yummy! It was the first chance hubby and I really had a chance to go out to eat without the kids,so we really wanted to make the most of our time.And we wre definetly able to do that here.Refills kept coming even after we had paid the bill.I also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the room.The only thing thats keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the tables were too close to each other,and it was so loud I could hear the discussion at the table next to me but I had a hard time hearing my huband across the table.I will definetly be going back to Pappadeux over and over again.",0
"Hit or miss food. I ordered the meat plate with corned beef, zuch and asparagus for the sides. Corned beef was WAY too salty, and same thin style you get on a sandwich. I sent it back for a chicken breast bone in, which was the driest chicken I have ever had. The side veggies were good (perfectly grilled no butter), and accompanied by garlic bread. I think this place has potential but I ordered wrong. I sat at the bar and service was mediocre. Price was pretty low though. Good place to watch the game.",0
"Absolutely the best sushi in the valley, hands down.  The fish is fresh and their spicy tuna is like no other.  However, the service is extremely slow. We once waited 75 minutes to get our lunch and the restaurant wasn't even full.  Can't say much about the cooked food though, but the sushi is amazing.",0
"It was as good as everyone says!  And sooo inexpensive...appetizers, entrees, and drinks for 3 people...about 30 bones.  Not to mention the mountain of leftovers we brought home.",0
"Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along.",0
Friend and I were planning on going to Postino's next door but it was already packed at 5:30 on a Thu... Anyway we tried out Aiello's and were happily surprised. I had the Scallops Venezia and my friend had the veal. Both were very well done and the bread was delicious.,0
"Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley, and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called ""Table side guacamole"" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" and ""Happy Birthday!"" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!",0
"I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.  

Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.  

Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm.",0
"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night for dinner because we had a restaurant.com gift certificate. Yes, it's in the Sheraton, and yes it's near the airport with not much else around, but I have to say- we were both impressed. 

We started with the Gambas al Fuego, which were deliciously spicy (although I thought that $10 for four shrimp was a bit excessive, no matter how tasty they were). We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.

If it wasn't so out of the way, we would definitely come by regularly. My husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich, so I think we'll be back during lunch in the near future. 

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was that the atmosphere was pretty dead. Which I suppose is understandable, given that it's inside the Sheraton. The decor was nice though. They should have a free standing restaurant in an area with more traffic- this place would be a hit.",0
"I love this restaurant!! I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years. Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg). And the food? Goes without saying, it's CRAVE worthy. This is a new location, so I expected the usual growing pains. But overall, a great dining experience. Welcome to the neighborhood, SOL Cocina!",0
"That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars. 

The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not. 

Service was great. 

I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)",0
"My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. 

What I had:
Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. 

I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good."" 

Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later. 

Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches.",0
Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.,0
"The florist manager is great, but i have not had a great experience with the night manager.  He seemed upset that i was stopping him from tidying the shelves to ask about putting an order in for flowers.

thought it was odd.",0
"I feel the Days Inn Tempe is best described as ""a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile."" 

I booked my 10-night stay on Travelocity for a non-smoking room, yet when I entered the room I almost choked. It was disgusting. I've never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I don't again. They said they couldn't move us to a different room.

My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is.

The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500.

I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby. The dollar store had a corkscrew.",0
"Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. I'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldn't suggest making this your regular hang out.",0
"Too bad about Mandalay Noodle World. Maybe if they had stressed better service and played up the Burmese aspect they would have had better luck. Who knows?

Betito's moved in, and they're okay. The wife and I stopped in yesterday. I had a carne asada torta and a taco and both were about average. Their hot salsa took it up a notch though. My wife had something with diablo in the name (sorry, I'll have to look at the menu when I get home) and loved it. They do the usual menudo on weekends and the whole place is more or less along the lines of a Filiberto's--not that there's anything wrong with that. The whole bill was less that $20, so prices are good. 

Clean enough place, cheap, food is okay, and service is adequate. I would not go out of my way to get there, but if it is in your neighborhood it is worth a try. I'll probably stop here from time to time.",0
"Excellent service and food.

Very clean.

Friendly folks.

Beautiful patio",0
"This is my 2nd time to this AMC.  I like it!  It is huge and clean.  The wait for tickets were quick and they have it set up that it is a hotel check in.  Not behind a bullet proof pawn shop set up.  LOL!  The concession area was huge with mutliple lines open.  Not much of a wait either.  

Walked into theater #10, not too shabby.  Pretty big screen and clean seats.  The speakers sounded great.  I had a great time.",0
"I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food, good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour, but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  I've only ever eaten sushi here, but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point, but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant.",0

"I'd love to give these guys a better review, because they were very friendly and professional.  However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.

On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!

When you advertise on your website ""showroom quality,"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.  I am really dissapointed that the attention to detail just wasn't there.  I was expecting so much more from a detail job.",0
"I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)! I love the ""hole in the wall"" feel. Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign. I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!",0
Very polite staff. Did not wait very long to be seen.,0
"Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(

The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.

I'll pass.",0
"Yes this is a chain but after traveling in Maui for a week and then coming back home to Kahlua Pork from Rumbi, I can honestly say that the Kahlua pork here is better than any of the places I ate it at in Hawaii. Crazy huh? The Kahlua pork at Rumbi is so moist and tender and when its paired with some of their magnificent teriyaki sauce and Rumbi rice (rice cooked with coconut milk and beans), it is out of this world. The Kahlua pork plate at Rumbi has lately been the first meal that comes to mind when I want comfort food. This is a bit of a problem cause that is normally on a work day during lunch and after eating a meal of pork, rice, mac salad, and coleslaw, I am just down right exhausted and in dire need of a nap. 
I used to come here quite frequently but forgot about this place and I am not sure why. Besides the Kahlua pork and Rumbi rice, I can say that their mac salad, sweet potato fries, and their beach burger are really good as well. If you are looking for something different, yet tasty and satisfying, try Rumbi. I think you will enjoy it.",0
"I like coming here when I want to pretend to read and then do some grocery shopping.  I say pretend to read becase, invariably, I start eaves dropping on people seated near me.  Usually these people are either a) real estate professionals on a lunch meeting or b) families with small children who are saying ridiculous things.  I've also run in to a guy my friend used to date while he is on a date... that was pretty strange.  I like their salads, the breakfast sandwhich with feta, and the portobello sanwhich (on ciabatta, not the recommended bread).  I am in love with the sweet potato sandwhich, but it is huge.  I recommend ordering a half or sharing it... even then it is a lot of sandwhich.  A scone will fill you up for the entire morning and afternoon. 

My mom requests a trip to ""the place next to the cool bookstore""  whenever she comes to town.  (p.s.  the cool bookstore is Changing Hands... and I agree with my mom -- it is very cool.)",0
"Service was faster than some of the other (but better) Indian restaurants I have been to in the area. The food was so-so. Nothing special. I enjoy spicy Indian food, but the ""hot"" was not. The only reason we ate there was the buy one get one free in the Phoenix area coupon book... no that, was a good value.",0
"Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first, given the fact that I really liked it.  What can I say?  I'm critical by nature.  I knew I was going back soon, so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit.  Well, it just got it.

This place is fantastic.  In fact, if CenPho lets this one go under, I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizen's arrest if I ever see you.  However, that is unlikely to happen, because the food is damn tasty.  

Today, the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning, topped with pickled onions; the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce.  The Soronan carne asada taco, char-grilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either; I'd rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town.  

Go to this place; I have a feeling I'll be here at least weekly.  When and if they ever get a beer/liquor license...probably more.",0
Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.,0
"I have been through plenty of airports around the world and I have to say that this one is on the better end. It is easy to navigate, clean (from what I have experienced), and makes getting to and returning rental cars a breeze. 

As in most airports, those who are not used to recent travel REALLY hold up the security check line. I would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and I held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag, fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech, but we were all able to make our flights. 

A word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their four-legged friends: allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by YOUR pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day. 

PLEASE CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PETS AT HOME. An unplanned trip to the ER as a result of YOUR inconsideration should be YOUR responsibility. What do you say about that, health care providers??? 

In all my travels, this has been the only time I have been stuck behind the hairiest cat I have ever seen in my life because its owners had more baggage than humanly possible to manage. Clueless to others distress as the owners, their pet left wheezing, sneezing, itching, gasping travelers in its wake. Are you from Naperville?",0
"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. The owner was snoring when I walked in, so that was odd and kind of a turn off. Their regular manicures are cheap- $10, but the experience overall was so-so. It got busier as my manicure was going on, so it got a little better. Parking is pretty bad..they have approx. 3 spaces. Manicure was fine..have a range of OPI but all their polishes were jumbled together which I hate. Overall, for a few dollars more there are better places, even down the street.",0
"Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service. Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch. Felt disrespected as a customer. Service sucks stay away. ""bad service = bad review""",0
"Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had, anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. I've never been to this place on the weekend when it isn't packed out the door. I'm not the only person that loves this place!",0
"This is simply a poor substitute for the Los Dos Molinos in South Phoenix.  It is a pale shade of itself.  The salsa is spicy, but it doesn't have any of the same excitement.  I think its partly the downtown location in a strip mall, (not that 98% of restaurants in Phoenix aren't in strip malls).  But the Mexcian Pizza and Chicken enchiladas just didn't have the same loving kick and spice.  When you are craving Mexican downtown, this'll do in a pinch.  But make room and time to head out to the original deal, the one with 5 alarm salsa and huge patios.  Margaritas the size of one's head and bring a group of friends to indulge!",0
"Went there for a second time on Sunday.  The first time I came, I was underwhelmed.  I think the problem was that I went with only one other and this time I came with 5 others.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and over pitchers of Sangria ($20.00 specials on Sunday) and copious amounts of food I rediscovered the restorative quality of good food and great friends.  Had serrano ham and manchego with quince paste, pollo colonial (my favorite), lamb with mustard and mint, pan con tomate, quail with lentils and chicken drumettes.  With the exception of the drumettes (which tasted like overly fancy buffalo wings), the rest of the food was exceptional.  Small portions, yes.  A smidge pricey yet, but the communal feeling of being with your good friends in the open air sharing vino and small plates is priceless.",0
"This place is fantastic!

We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm. The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves, take our time, ask if we had any questions. We wandered around for a bit, I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted, and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe. 

Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night. 

This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit, just said ""show me your favorite."" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.

We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!

Prices are on par with Total Wine, but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job. Great job Sportsman's, see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking!",0
"I'm torn.


I LOVED my $20 facial. I'll probably go back for more once Groupon and the like run out of deals.

However, I also got a brow and eyelas tinting.  I wouldn't recommend that service from here.  My brows were uneven, and my lashes faded out quicker than normal.",0
"Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.",0
"What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. ""Come on honey, it's an adventure!"". 

We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! 

I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special ""gluten free"" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!

The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)",0
"I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didn't end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected.",0
"I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location, but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do, I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And it's the best coffee I've ever had.",0
Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce. Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.,0
"Been there, done that.  Fair sandwiches (better than Safeway, anyway).  Only 2 stars since I didn't know about the free soft serve, so didn't get to try that.

There's gotta be a good New York-style deli west of the 17 and north of Thunderbird.  Isn't there?  Doesn't have to be great.  Good would be wonderful.",0
"Where to begin?

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.

Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. 

It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.

If you haven't gone... you're missing out.",0
"I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...

The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.",0
"Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is.

Just think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions.",0
"eewh! yuck and wtf!?

This Barnes & Noble Book Store sucks for sitting back, relaxing and trying to read. I know it is not a library, and I don't expect it to be. But, come on - you can at least have some sense of trying to keep the noise level down and have some cozy seating. 

And... Yikes! The people here are gross. They had some couch-chairs to lounge in and they were - in all of their grossness. And they were reading magazines of all things. WTF buy it and go home and let your kids do kart wheels there. EEWH!

Then, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every 5 minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either. 

I was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.

I have been looking for a place to go to read, work and drink some coffee in my area (Arrowhead) and this one is definitely crossed off of my list. 

Come here to try and find a book but don't come expecting to kick back and enjoy your novel or what have you. If you like people watching though, this may be your place. There are all kinds here.

PS: and I left my fav coffee mug at this crappy place - like I will go back and get it. I think I would burn it first - bummer!",0
"Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.

Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.

Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!",0
This place is not there anymore.,0
Gaylee is great! She is super sweet and so professional! Her work is amazing. I found her through one of those online deals and now I am convinced that I will never go elsewhere. Keep up the great work!,0
"No frills.  Nothing fancy.  Just some honest burritos and tacos.  Voted ""best taco"" by New Times a few years back (in the 90's).  Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy.  They make a hearty breakfast burrito too.  If you're looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filiberto's, try somewhere else.  The red burro combo is my personal favorite.  It's saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough.  Bottled beer available.",0
"Went here this morning around 10 am. There was like a 20 minute wait, but no biggie. Service was fast, orders were fresh and correct, and place was clean. It is the Waffle House, not a fancy joint. So for what it is, it was good. Plus the staff are all very easy going and create a fun lively atmosphere. Good for a casual breakfast.",0
"Where do I begin? I love Casey Moore's!

What a great ambiance! The outside patio is where it's at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.

When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). 

It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!

The oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses.

If you're feeling pretty ballsy, go pee on the Blarney Stone! Every time I go there I wish I was a man so I could do it.",0
"Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse.",0
"Service was good, however my fettucine alfredo with meatballs was just OK. I would pass on this menu item the next and try something different.",0
"So, I went because of all the hype. Immediately, realized how overrated it was. The ambiance is like a Chilis but trying to be mexican.",0
"Ok, so I'm catching up on past-due reviews.  For me, Chipotle is one of those places you go to when you want something to eat from critters that have been decently treated while giving their life for your enjoyment.  And the food is ok too.  The guacamole is always fresh, the burrito's are big and there are lot's of add-ins.  Just don't expect any gustatory excitation, it's pretty basic, non-threatening, and I think I heard somebody refer to it as gabacho mexican food.  I think that pretty well sums it up.  However, a big plus is that the iced tea is always fresh and all-you-can-drink :-)",0
"Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. 

Gils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. 

I had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? 

The whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good. 

The rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back. 

The place was clean and they made a nice patio outside, complete with waterfall and everything.",0
Good pizza. Nice and laid back. Good staff too.,0

"I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, there's a good variety of ""ethnic"" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out. 

Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials 

They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!",0
"I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite. 

Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho.",0
"Only had a chance to experience the Oscuro (amber lager) and the pizza (the Arizona vs. Boston) so far but it's enough to make me want to come back and try more.

Lots of flat screens. Should be a great place to spend a Sunday afternoon watching footbal in the fall.",0
"Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6"" could easily eat off of them.  

Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.

I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say ""it's organic, don't panic"".  

Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!",0
"In addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the $2 bloody marys are a buy. Downside: parking validation is only a discount, not a freebie. Depending on when you go the service can be slow. During a recent happy hour the barmaid herself was left to tend to all bar patrons and the patio.",0
"Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that! 

Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).

Nice laid back decor too.

You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order.

I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!

I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!

The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)

I can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!",0
"Great experience from start to finish.  Host (who was the owner) seated us at a table with a view.  Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil.  Was awesome.  Some of the best bread I've ever had before a meal.  The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.  The pasta came with shrimp, squash, and some other vegetables.  I love pesto, so this hit the spot.  Good serving size, but not too much.  The food tasted fresh.  They make their own pasta, which was delicious.  The burger was huge.  Looked like you get your moneys worth.  The ice tea was even good.  The place was clean and sleek.  They played good music and the service was perfect.  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.  I will be coming back.  The host, who we later found out was the owner, was working that night and asked us how we liked everything.  I've said it before, but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant.  Well done.",0
"Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.",0
We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!,0
"Games- great.
Game prices- decent.
Food- Edible, but nothing to write home about.
Food prices- WAY too high for the quality.
Bar- Weird. The 1st bar Ive heard of that doesnt carry Baileys or some type of Irish cream liqueur.
Drinks- Meh, stick w/ beer.
Service- Also weird. Ive had the best service here when its crazy busy and the absolute worst when my friends and I are the only people to be waited on.

A good time, if youre going for games and basic drinks.",0
"I love the ambiance at Joe's Farm Grill.  It's great to grab your food and sit outside at one of the many picnic tables.  Stopping there with the dogs after an afternoon at Cosmo Dog Park is a must!  There is something for everyone on the menu, from gourmet burgers (all I have to say is fontina! Yum!) to pizza, to ribs.

It's also a great place to take out-of-state guests who just blew into town from one of those cold climates.  They are usually psyched to be sitting outside enjoying a meal during the winter without having a propane heater involved.  

Make sure you go for a walk on the grounds too.  It's very relaxing and a great way to work off a few calories!",0
"Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?",0
"I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.",0
"What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.

Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.

I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.",0
Had the enchiladas - cheese and shredded beef - and some mini chimichangas which were both good. Salsa is fresh and tasty. Friendly service. Will be back next time I'm in Florence!,0
"I found this place when we needed a place to meet for a business lunch.  I had the smoked BBQ chicken which was good but that seems to be all I get when I go.  I've tried some of the other dishes but haven't really liked them.  My wife loves the fried pickles which I'm not a fan of.  The portions are huge but there does not seem to be anything special I can remember besides really large portions.  I suppose the biscuits topped with sugar smothered in honey butter are good but I also want to live to be at least 50 and they are not worth dying for.  As unimpressed as I am with the food, the service is very good.  I've been there a few times now and have always been pleased with they way they treat us.  Everything from the speed and attentiveness has been good.",0
"AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.

You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.

Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.

They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.

Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)",0
"Sugar bowl ice cream is yummy but what ice cream isn't? let's just say if one day I was craving ice cream, I wouldn't think of coming here specifically for theiiir tubs. Very average stuff.. similar to Breyers/ Dryers. 

What I diiid like was the price, their abundant seating area and location (=",0
"Great place for lunch, transport yourself back in time to this quaint farm grill which offers high quality food, fresh ingredients, killer burgers and an atmosphere that is one of a kind.  Good place for breakfast as well.  Family owned restaurant goodness.  Only drawback is the line, however good things come to those who wait.",0
"My girlfriend liked this place more than I did. It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. 

The service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of ""everything is good, just order something so I can go home"". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. 

It wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better"", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.",0
"Other then the chips and salsa (5 stars for salsa) the food is good, but not so much that I go out of my way to eat there. The fajitas are delish, with mushrooms and the meat always tender, but the price makes me cringe. At over $20 there are so many other places I rather eat. I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub.... Some of the servers are not the friendliest, but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever, so don't take it personally....
But overall it is a Scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good.",0
"Man, if these guys were trying to replicate a gringo bar in Mexico down to every last detail, then they have it absolutely nailed. Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.

Rumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.",0
"Fun, with caps if I did that sort of thing. The whole experience was great (you won't get any specifics, this review is 3 weeks after, I can't remember, sorry). Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly. Explain food, wine, doesn't stay too long. Nice interesting big room decor. Looking forward to the next time.",0
"Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good.",0
"A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!",0
"I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a ""glorified Red Lobster""). 

I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food. 

The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying. 

I can't wait to come back here.",0
"This is a tough one.  I'd found out about Mrs. White's by way of Lo-Lo's, and thought I'd try Mama's food before Son's.  It was good, I'll say that.  I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading.  Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat.  Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good.

The ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact ""Jesus"".  LOL.

Unaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars.  Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin.

As a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable.  Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of ""what are YOU doing here?"" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.

I'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.  I love small business and I'm proud of Mrs. White for making it this long; hope she continues for a long time to come.",0
The food here is generally pretty good.  Drink selection is great.  Service is normally above average.  The only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is that it's a bit expensive relative to comparable quality places.,0
"On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!

PS GET THERE EARLY!!",0
"The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that ""I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour"" feeling.

The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  

I am hooked!",0
"had the place to ourselves on a thurs nite (5/19) so...service great, mgr came over and asked if we had eaten here before ""nope"" so he said he wanted to buy dessert, ""great, thank you"" oreo cheesecake was good... now.... pizza...pricey by 2-4 bucks but was very good. can't go wrong with your toppings but the riccotta was not my cup of tea (wife liked it on her pizza). definetly going back to try it again... great crust",0
"Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different. 

I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.

Service=slow.
Food=just tastes like salt
Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.

Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.",0
"After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.  

I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly.",0
"They serve breakfast all day, which is always a plus.  

I had the tomato soup with grilled cheese.  The bread was delcious, tasted homemade.  However, there was way too much cheese, and it wasn't fully melted.  

My g/f had the eggs benedict, which looked really good.  She said it was really good, and filling.  

3 stars.  I've had better.  I've had worse.  La de da.",0
"I want to like Turf, but the food is just okay.  I've only been here twice, but it was not mind-blowing.

I'm not fond of the shepherd's pie here.  It is the most bland version I have had... even in this town.  

The wings, however, are pretty good.  I've eaten wings here with a couple Harps and have had a decent time.

Surprisingly good is their seared ahi tuna.  It is pretty weird to think an Irish pub would do this well, but they do.  A friend ordered it and after shaking my head and saying there's no way it could be good, I tried a bite and I had to eat crow.  

Turf is typically a stop on the pub crawl, so I will definitely be back again for boozing.",0
"I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.

I'll tell you ""Why NOT""... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.

That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.

Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!

It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced ""gourmet"" pizza joint.

If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc.",0
"I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.",0
"I thought Trader Vic's was very nice.  Food was very good.  Atmosphere was great.  Staff was very very friendly and fun.  They even gave me tons  of recommendations of places to eat in the area since I am new around here.  

I recommend the lamb.",0
"Excellent service and food           

enjoyed live music on patio",0
"I was fairly surprised to visit Line Thai and find some decently authentic, good-tasting Thai food. I'd always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents' place in Surprise.

Anyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it ""phat si iew"") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.

The hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.

The service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.

My parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.

The atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and it's not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really.

All in all, it was a nice experience at a reasonable price and I'll definitely make a visit next time I hang out with the 'rents.",0
Love Krista!,0
"Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  

One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.  

I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!",0
"Fun Irish-pub type vibe with a great beer selection and not your typical bar food. I love the oysters on the half-shell, salads, sandwiches and fried zucchini/mushroom combo.

Casey's offers inside dining and a bar - but the expansive patio is the hang-out spot. The clientele is varied and full of regulars. People from all ages and backgrounds hang out here but it's especially popular with ASU students, staff and faculty. 

The only downside is parking can be difficult, service sometimes slow and it can become fairly crowded - especially on the weekend.",0
"You may think this is a cop out... writing a review of Starbucks. It's like writing a review of water. (""It's wet, delicious and necessary to my survival!"") 

My aim is simple here though. This particular Starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching. Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors. While attending school, I was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 35 random people. Where did I go to write every single one of them? Park Central Starbucks. 

The crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.

The coffee... been there, done that and there's not much else I can say about it, but for the sport of people-watching, this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in.",0
"nice location , good service but a little slow. been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold, they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice.. overall i enjoy the food and would go back.",0
"I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one. Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!

Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!

Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!

So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!",0
"I have either an extreme LOVE or DISLIKE for this place. More love, though. 
Things I love: 
Great wine, with all different price points, which is nice. Cool, speakeasy atmosphere. Great bands and entertainment. Great cheese platter and flat breads. Good prices. 
Things I do not love: 
Service. Are you a bouncer? A bartender? Are you leading me to a seat? can you get me a seat? Its confusing. The staff is not clearly defined (not only do they not wear uniforms, or name tags, but they are scarce and hard to find) 
The mix. It is kind of a random mix. I guess that can be a good thing, but I was there once and it was like Spring Break in Cabo, and then the other time, it was like 50+ snow birds day. Either one is fine, it is just hard to gage when to go and who to bring, like, my mom, or my pals. 
They serve dessert, but no coffee. That, to me, is just strange. Buy a coffee maker. Sheesh. They have this amazing fondue that would be great with some baileys and coffee, and alas, no coffee. Strange. I know, ""wine bar"", but if you serve dessert, coffee should go hand in hand. 

In the end, the place is cool and they have some of the best entertainment there. they ambiance is nice. Go early for a seat, they are hard to come by. Beware of paying $ at the door for an entertainment fee, but it is well worth it.",0
"I have visited MacAlpine's a few times, and every time I have been very pleased with both the food and the service.  The wait staff and the owners are always very friendly and helpful and the food, although nothing fancy, is always good.  I love the atmosphere of this restaurant as well as the neighboring thrift shop that is fun to browse while the food cooks.  And the egg cream sodas are delicious!  Not to mention visiting a piece of Phoenix history at the same time - I love it!  The only downside to this place? I wish they were open later into the evening...",0
"I've never eaten at this location; both times I've had it was to-go. The first time I had a pulled pork sandwich, and a side of the beans. The pork was extremely dry and tasteless without the sauce. The sauce I found was overly seasoned. And the beans had way too much pepper. 

The second time I had HB's was a work lunch that we had this delivered. Once again, the pork was completely dry, but not as dry as the pulled chicken, which my coworkers complained about. 

I prefer Hap's BBQ over this place for sure.",0
"Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...

AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!

Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?

This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.

You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say ""THANK YOU!!"" for the great service you provide and the products you offer.",0
"Love me some hidden house! 

The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.",0
"Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.  My only wish is that the serving was bigger!  I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.  The flavors in this salad are amazing!  Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing.

For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!

I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.  Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!",0
"Great Mexican food. 
Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes. 
Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada
Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.",0
"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but.. well.. let me explain. 


I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had ""reserved"" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy. 

The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. 

The food is best described as ""home cooking"". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland? 

Overall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars.",0
"This is my first dinner stop anytime I'm in Scottsdale, and always makes me look good when I recommend it.

This time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the  Cadillac marg.  Tablemates had other dishes they raved about.

Noteworthy notes:

I've not yet sat on the patio, but I can't explain why.  It looks awesome.

The margaritas are sufficiently stiff.  They're not my preferred carburetor cleaning strength, but neither are they simply jazzed-up lemonade or those super-acidic-1.0 pH version you get some places.

The service was a little lax this time, less attentive than before, and that's the only reason I'm not giving LS a 5 this time.

If you're after Mexican when in Scottsdale, this is the first place to point your ride.",0
"The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good.

I am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no.

Oh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no.",0
"I have been graciously reminded by many people that a ""bruin"" is a kind of bear.

Sorry guys... I'm an AZ native (we don't have bears here in Phoenix) with the classic AZ school system education. :)",0
"I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 ""designer brand"" surcharge (no, I am not kidding). Despite branding as ""green"" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green, silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!",0
"I used to frequent the Lost Leaf almost daily starting the day they opened, unfortunately I cannot say the same anymore. I used to love the refrigerator full of beers, the music, and the cool little home, not to mention the biggest thing, the promise of a full bar. Now, everytime I go there it's full of douchebags, they are out of the beer I want, and the music has somehow become sucky. Perhaps the biggest kicker... there is still no full bar! The servers are surly kids, who have the audacity to tell you were you cannot stand, seemingly forgetting they work in the hospitality industry. If this were a city with a ton of good bars, that would never fly. But since they are one of the only games in the area, most people go back just out of convienence. The last time I was there, we coaxed a bum to dance to 1920's tunes that were being played out of the treehouse out front. That was about the only redeeming quality. And I swear if I see one more dude with girls jeans trying to look cool with a bomber of the worst beer imaginable I'm gonna snap.

Thanks for ruining what could have been an awesome hang out spot guys.",0
"Yes, the view is wonderful. Absolutely. 

Sadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. 

The decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.

Our party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. 

I was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. 

The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.

The service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.

Valet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience, food and atmosphere alike. However, the service did bring me down a bit.",0
"My first visit was roughly two weeks ago when I got a Mediterranean pizza over lunch.  Service was friendly and prompt and the whole meal cost ~$4.

Today, I stood around waiting for help for about 5 minutes without anyone so much as saying 'hi.'  One employee looked at me several times but ultimately went back to stocking shelves each time.  I could see people in the back and the general manager talking on his cell phone.  I decided to ultimately leave rather than waste any more time.  Disappointing at best.",0
"What a fabulous dining experience! My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place.",0
"Where are the managers????   It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening.  Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.  Food was WAY over priced, and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.  Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry.  HORRIBLE!",0
"This place is busy, but the kids love the pancakes so much food for the price.",0
"I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didn't get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back, they are always friendly.",0
"Mmm. The cream cheese and potato soup always perks me up when I'm getting sick, and I love their chocolate chip scones! I've had their ravioli too, they're yummy. Wildflower is homey and consistent!",0
"Ugh...I had never been to a Waffle House, but my southern friends who frequent them a lot back home convinced me to try it out for a late night creep.  The food is just sub par and sits hard in your belly.  All I ordered was waffles and I wasn't impressed.  I do appreciate that they are open late, so I wont' ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"".  The cocoa was cool and the server was cute, sweet and attentive.  Fortunately for me, my taste buds are already spoiled with The Good Egg.  I'm so sorry I cheated on you baby!",0
Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure.,0
"This place is wonderful! The service is amazing and food is delicious. 

I especially enjoyed the Clams Oreganato appetizer.  

The Eggplant Parm lunch special came with pasta and choice of soup or salad.  What a great deal!",0
"Angel Sweet Gelato is a welcome treat on a hot day. It sits in a small strip in the middle of Mesa Riverview, but if you can find it (west of Logan's), it's worth a stop.

The selection of flavors is large, including a dozen dairy-free fruit flavors that aren't quite as decadent as the dairy gelatos in the left-hand case. I've tried the lemon and all the berry flavors, and haven't found anything that wasn't delicious. The prices are reasonable, and you can order sizes from one small scoop to a big box (all unfortunately served in styrofoam).

There isn't a lot of seating in Angel Sweet, but I've never seen it full. Get a punch card if you live in the area. If you like firemen, this would be a good place to see them hanging out.  =)",0
"Last nights To-Go order: 
Char Burger w/avocado. Burger was delicious ~ Yum! 
Extra crispy french fries were perfect!
Price was reasonable for a burger of this caliber. 
No drive-thru
No waiters
Staff very friendly

I WILL BE GOING BACK!!!!",0
"I have not had better chinese food since moving to Arizona.  The restaurant was 3/4 full on a Tuesday night!!!  With many Asian people.  I thought in this ""recession"" that having a restaurant that packed was a pretty amazing thing.  The service was superb.  The food was overall yummy.  I did not enjoy the greasy wonton chips that are served for free before the meal.  My friend really like them though?!?!  The hot tea was good.  My veggie dish (something with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, green pepper, broccoli, ect.) and steamed rice was good.  I ate every single bite.  The free dessert (wontons filled with banana and others with plum maybe?) were yummy.  The total bill with tax and tip for 2 entrees and 1 soda was $24.  I left full and happy.",0
"Probably the most overrated place in the Phoenix area. There pizza tastes way too much like their canned tomato sauce and there is always a wait to be seated. 

That being said there food overall is OK. There meat salad and cal-zones are good and the servers are friendly. For all the people out there giving it more than 3 stars: try other pizza places like spinatos, la grande Orange, pizzeria Bianca.",0
"Alright, so here is my two cents on Brat Haus. I suggest to steer clear of the brats I tried (Beer Brat & Spicy Thai).  I found them a bit dry and bland.  I also found the pretzels less than fabulous. I do suggest to try to big, juicy, tasty, meatballs. Much better choice. The outside patio very cool, an open fresh space with plenty of seating and a big ol' wall of funky art. The service was also friendly, and attentive and fair prices. Overall, it's totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for something different.",0
"Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. 

About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. 
My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. 
There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes.
Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast",0
"On a early Saturday evening, the band was playing the crowd was just starting to meander in.  Going further inside in an attempt to avoid the high volume of the band whose audio was piped in throughout the restaurant (I failed) I realized shortly that I must of been missed siting in the middle of the dinning are as the wait staff moved smartly from the kitchen to the front delivering the drinks and food to the patrons. I ask a member of the staff was I sitting in the wrong area and soon service was rendered.  

Food, nothing special but it is more of a bar than a restaurant.  Although the atmosphere was unique, I do have a question why cameras were in the mens room.",0
Love this location at Gainey Ranch! Great food consistently!,0
Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.,0
"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.  

Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.

The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)

The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!""

On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing.",0
"I agree with others that it seems a bit expensive at $15- but that still would not steer me away from going.

For the first time in about 8 years I found myself at the DBG with some out of town family. Wanting to enjoy the weather (since they had just escaped the cold grey winter of Detroit) the gardens were the perfect spot. The garden is equipped with wide paths and plenty of benches to help the old timers pace themselves. It helps remind us city dwellers of the beauty the desert can have and how unique Phoenix truly is.",0
"Wed-Sat, sit at the bar and ask for bartender JOY. She's a GAS!
Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service.

--hummus appetizer with sample of olives is great choice
--crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab
--tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting
--side salad for ciabatta ""sandwich"" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame!
--chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheese

Now, to Joy. She's a keeper. First visit, we struggled with the proper preparation of a Sapphire martini, but it was primarily the fault of our server's communication skills. Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist! Congrats, my lady.

If you can get past the chick-chosen wallpaper (wrong) and perfect-sphere fake tabletop plants from restoration, the different-height tables mix up the room just right and make it feels shabby chic without the white.

Say hi to Joy. =)",0
We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty,0
"I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it, easy peasy. Love it!",0
The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress,0
"This has been a long time coming and is one more huge step in the development of Phoenix as an urban center of the United States. 

I have a stop three blocks from my house at Central & Thomas. I have ridden from there to Tempe and it only took about 20 minutes to get there. The stops at each station are very quick and efficient. Everyone is in and out and the train is on it's way again. The ride across the lake is a beautiful way to enter Tempe. From there, it's just a short walk to Casey Moore's and all the other spots I enjoy in Tempe.

The last star is missing from this review because service ends far too early on the weekends. I understand not wanting to deal with the after 2 am crowd, but could we get at least 1:00 am or 1:30 am on the weekends!?",0
"OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day... 

The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course. 

Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake? 

Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.",0
We had a delicious meal with great service.  Awesome!,0
"What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )",0
"A friend of a friend recommended Lou/Autoplex and I couldn't be happier.  Lou provides honest, fast service and is a pleasure to deal with.  No runaround, no nonsense, honest auto service.  Extremely difficult to find these days... I went to him for a muffler/tailpipe and then later for a catalytic converter and was completely happy with the outcome.  Additionally, he pointed out other things that I should see my previous mechanic about that they needed to fix/finish.  :)",0
"Excellent New Mexico style food, great hatch green chile.",0
"We have been to this location to buy gear prior to the Fiesta Bowl.  Yes, things are way overpriced, but that is the premium one pays for licensed merchandise.  One nice thing is that they had a buy one, get one half off deal.  Was nice for our large crew.  Nice selection of NFL, NBA and MLB gear.  Friendly staff, good location.  If you feel the need to buy licensed sports gear when you are in the area, worth the trip.",0
"Went here last night with another couple for dinner.  The pitcher of margaritas was spot on, the chips were outstanding along with the guacamole and salsa.  I ordered the tortilla soup which I ended up sending back cuz to be honest it tasted and looked like a bowl of enchilada sauce.  My husband ordered the filet and enchilada which I have to say was cooked perfectly and definitely would order if I ever went back.  The other couple ordered the beef short ribs which I didn't taste but they both agreed it was over cooked. Service was great but when I have to send something back which I rarely do I can't give more then 3 stars.",0
"Arizona definitely lack cool spots, but luckily they have The Vig. The venue has a nice patio area--perfect for warmer nights, but the inside tables are fine too.  


My friends brought me on a Sunday night where all their bottle wines are 50%off... which is pretty awesome. The service was friendly and the food was legit. Try the ""Good ol' Steak Salad"" and Crabmeat Artichoke dip! 

btw the valet is $3.",0
I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.,0
"I am at work today, talking to my co-worker, letting her know that I was going to Taco Bell for lunch.  She looked at me disappointed, and said ""I never want to hear that you are gaining weight again...stop eating that!""  She then told me about Sacks....I decided that I would give it a shot. (not that is was any healthier....)
I wasn't real impressed with the layout of the place, even where it was located.  It was getting busy when I walked in...and had no idea what to order.  I ended up with the Van Gogh, which was roast beef, dill, alfalfa sprouts, cheese and I subsituted the marble rye for a tomato basil bread.  The girl at the counter was really sweet and helpful at helping me pick out what I wanted.  
My sandwich was really good, and it wasn't just a normal sandwich.  I also liked the little cookie that they snuck into my bag.  And the fact that they have Stewart's root beer was a nice bonus.
The only thing that I could say that was negative is that I left there still smelling the kitchen on my coat.  And it wasn't pleasant.",0
"we went here for dinner and drinks, and it was awesome. the giant soft pretzels are amazing, buttery, and delicious and are served with a roasted pepper cheese sauce. they are awesome, but get them to share, the butteryness is rich! the prices are reasonable, and the patio is nice to sit out on! even better than the food, service, and prices is the music!! they play an awesome selection of music!!",0
"ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to ""Bobby MaGees"" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).

But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).

We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...

I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). 

The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. 

Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.

But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.

I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.

Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of ""west side"" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached).",0
"My wife and I decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we were traveling with our 5-month old, so you can imagine we were a little apprehensive. 

The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb.  Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. 

The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one.  The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. 

So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour.  The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen.  I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. 

Still, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun.  Cheers.",0
"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!

I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.

The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.",0
"Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties. 

Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.",0
"We are lucky enough to live basically right accross the street.  

The food is great. Love the thin crust pizzas and the sweet potato fries. They grow a lot of their own veggies. They seasonally sell dates at the farmstand that are GREAT. 

You get your food free on your birthday.

Gets very crowded on the weekends!

the dessert is just OK, but the shakes are great!",0
"This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.",0
"This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years. 

Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating. 

I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season....",0
The server could have been better. She spilled a coke on my lap. This made me late for my movie. The wait was so-so however the food was cooked to my liking. I will go back.,0
"Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation. 

The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was "" Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on"" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.

Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food. 

Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier. 

Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste...",0
"I had a hankering for raw fish today and decided to give Moto a try.  Overall I was pleased.

The menu had a wide variety of tempting Asian treats but I was here for fish, so I ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of Miso.

The soup was a bit odd.  It seemed to be normal Miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in.  The cabbage added a texture that I didn't really want but it was easy to eat around it.

The presentation of the sashimi was interesting.  I had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail, smoked salmon and tuna.  The fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous.

When I need a sushi fix for lunch I'll be returning to Moto.",0
"Was extremely psyched to try Lobby's, considering all of the great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed with the results. I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull, featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries, and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable, and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing, but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty, quality burger place, frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce, to boot.. Thanks bro, but I don't need any secret sauce favors.",0
Great service,0
"My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience. GREAT staff.",0
"I love this place! Great flavors, love the tiny gummy bear toppings.

One thing I don't like is the inconsistent hours. One day they'll be open at 8, the next time they close at 7:30. When our yogurt craving hits, we'd love to patronize Woody's, but never know if they're going to be open.

I tried over and over to call one night, and the phone was just constantly busy. A little frustrating!

I do enjoy their yogurt, but with the weird hours, and so-so feel from the staff it's hard to give them more than 3 stars.",0
"First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back.",0
"This is a nothing but pies place...so I was expecting a little bit more oomph...

Dispointing small selection of pie by the slices...also you gotta put in special order ahead of time for the more interesting stuff like Italian Ricotta.  

I was going to order something with berries, but the stuff I saw in the case was just runny and wet looking...so I ended up with a black-bottom pie...I really liked the flaky crust and the filling wasn't bad except for the fact that it did taste a bit over refrigerated.  

A minor gripe is the airpot coffee...not freshly brewed...despite the espresso machine clearly visibile behind the counter.

The pies are just over $4 per slice and ~$20 per pie.",0
"I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. 

The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say ""sacrificed or as important"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). 

The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, ""don't wear pants,"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly ""cooler"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? 

The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. 

Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.",0
"I liked the tortillas:  handmade, rich and salty.  I thought the food was decent.  I thought service was okay.  I am not new to Mexican food, I know what I want:  when I say I want cheese and cilantro and tomatillo salsa,  please give it to me.  They charged me and extra dollar for had smattering of queso fresca.  Boo.  I liked the mango-pineapple aqua, super sweet and clean flavor.  I would go back, maybe.",0
"Back from holiday and had some amazing soups that made me reflect back on my experience here.  I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor.",0
"Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.",0
"The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume.",0
"Thank you Yelp for my first opportunity to enjoy Gammage.

Impressive architecture and design (it is also mostly functional)!  
The seats are roomier than expected and the rows have just enough room between them to allow people to pass relatively easily in front of you without having to stand up to let them through.[Relative to US Airways Center seats which outside of Lexus Club and courtside seats are several inches narrower than the ones at Gammage and you have to stand up every time someone needs to pass.]
Having the room to pass easily is nice, especially if you are seated in the middle of the auditorium, since you have to pass in front of at least 30 people just to get to your seat if your, say, running late or need to escape to the restroom.  
This is also a negative especially if you are the crowd-fearing  or clostrophobic type, there are not good ""outs"" from the center.  

I think it is wonderful to have a location that hosts wonderful Broadway performances and a variety of other artistic entertainment/performances.",0
"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.

Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!

Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!",0
"I'm  going to stop being such a taker, and give for once! I use Yelp along with other reputable websites to help make my dining, travel and shopping decisions and I never take the time to give back!! I know, I know....awful. I'm turning over a new leaf! Here is my first Yelp. Please don't judge. It's my first time.... Okay, here goes. So, I went to Matt's for the first time a few days ago....

Food- Amazing.  Best pancakes ever! I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.

The building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings.",0
"over 20 visits - and no rvw?  wow - i must be loosing it.

When I walk through the beautiful shoping district of Kierland, it is always fun to window shop - ok gotta go in! - and touch, feel, ooo, ya - and dream about having my home decorated with all thier furnishings... as soon as i win the lottery.. or something... almost there.  (maybe i should stop travelling......... nah...)

anyWHO - you CAN find some GR8 little snags: from candles, to books, vases, martini glasses (always a must, since somehow - not sure why, mine keep getting smashed - maybe goes hand-in-hand with vodka + consumption + beautiful galsses = tipsy, topsy, turvy - crash)

I always enjoy looking, (and usually grabbing something i ""need"" ya, right) and thinking about where or what I might get for a gift - naaaaaaah - for me!  next...",0
"we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!  we couldn't resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.  this is definately going to be one of our ""regular joints.""  if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.  i bet you will like this place.  
there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin' ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin'.  i love this place.  this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!",0
"How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings? 

I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.

But the food was way way too ""greasy."" And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there....",0
"If you're the type that are into choices, then Gelato 64 has got your number.  Their number stands for the 64 flavors of gelato that you can choose from.  When I was there they seem to be a couple of flavor short since several of the slot in the gelato case was empty...but anything approaching 60 is already a ridiculously wide range of selection.

The gelato was well flavored and had a nice smooth texture.  Extra star for range of flavor.",0
"My boyfriend and I were in Arizona on vacation for a wedding. The food was better than the average deli and they give you a free cookie with your order too. It is a shame they don't have these in malls near me. Although I read on their website that they have one at the Galleria which would have been nice when I lived in Davis, CA for college. 

Shopping really works up an appetite and this satisfied it well. and light enough not to ruin a dinner as we had a wedding to attend later that evening.",0
"I stopped in one afternoon and ordered some baba and a chicken salad. The baba was good, and served with a ton of pita quarters. The salad was good too, except that most of the chicken was burnt. 
The cashier was pleasant and must be related to the guys doing the cooking. They were giving her a hard time about a male customer who I guessed must come in a lot and she was giving it right back to them! Kinda funny. I will definitely be back for takeout and lunch again while shopping. I will go for the gyro salad next time though.",0
"This is the best mall in Arizona.  Lots of high end shops and nice restaurants.  Except during the holidays, plenty of covered parking.",0
"I didn't pay much attention to this place for several years.  Passed it many times, just didn't catch my eye enough for me to remember it on those nights when I desperately try to think of some new place to try.

I've since been here twice (over about a 3 month time span), and I really love it.  First time, had great food (all server recommendations - although he disappeared prior to arrival of meal, seemed to be doing side work so he could bolt out).  Great although somewhat minimal service for the second half of our dinner, former waiter did not say he was leaving, we sat for a little while before someone new arrived.  Ambiance and company made it barely noticeable.   Personally, I don't care as long as I get good service.  We're not family, I don't need an apology or heartfelt goodbye.  The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, it's probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.  I consider myself a good cook, but I would leave this up to Richardsons.  As I write this I realize the whole reason for my review is that dish, because I don't remember anything else I had.  Stopped by for drinks the second time, ended up ordering a pizza, expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu, it was really quite good.  Bartender was great (I think he was actually the take-over waiter from my previous visit).  Very cozy place, if you come later or are are willing to wait, you can get a private table in a cave like nook.  The place is not cheap, comparative to other finer dining establishments.  Overall, a lively but romantic place with character, good food, and decent service.",0
"Yum!
Steaks were great! Corn bread

large portions
definitely worth the price!",0
I much prefer drinking here to eating here.  Sometimes it is the only place close and I decide to order food and I always regret it.  I'm a vegetarian so maybe I'm too limited and the burgers are awesome   So stick to traditional fare.  The salads my daughter and I had yesterday were pathetic,0
"I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!  I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know.",0
It seems like there is not as much value for your dollar at Gold Medal.  We had been there since the new school opened but decided to move on.  We got a 'can't we get you to stay' call which felt like desperation on their part.  My daughter enjoyed her lessons but her favorite teacher left (as most do) and the cost was not worth it anymore.  I would not recommend them to my friends.,0
"If I could give this 2.5 stars, I would.  But that's because I've been to Joe's Real BBQ, and so I know how good BBQ can be.

Famous Dave's is fine.  There are two of them I know of, and I've been to both.  They're both fine.

We visited this one, near Chandler mall, for lunch.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  My wife and I both had the brisket sandwich.  I had the Wilbur beans, she had fries.  It was fine.  Not great, but OK.

The brisket meat itself did not seem to be smoked.  At all.  Meat has a certain look and taste when it has been smoked, and this just didn't have it.  Frankly, the meat seemed sorta pale...as if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked.  And either the meat or the sauce was excessively salty.  It wasn't severe (or I would have returned it), but it was noticeable.  Salt should enhance flavor, not stand out as a major flavor.

And a note about the sauce.  I examined one of their 'for sale' bottles (you can buy their sauce to take home).  Did they use molasses or brown sugar, as most self-respecting BBQ chefs would?  No.  High fructose corn syrup.  Yuck.  Besides that stuff being poison to your pancreas, it's just ""not right"".  That's not how BBQ is done.

Anyway, Famous Dave's is really nothing special.  The BBQ is ""OK"", but not very authentic.  Given the choice I would take Joe's, hands-down.  But if you want some BBQ, and are nowhere near Joe's, this will do.  Beats the heck out of Tom's BBQ, that's for sure (see my review of Tom's...truly awful).  And the beans and fries are pretty good.",0
"I've been here twice now for the lunch buffet and the second time I even brought a friend who was a foodie and both times it was great. They have a great selection of dips on the buffet, a few salads and many warm entrees to choose from. 

I recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you won't be disappointed. Everything is absolutely delicious and you'll have fun guessing the spices in the various dishes. 

If you're in the mood for some tasty middle eastern food, I would really recommend it. It's a little short on ambiance, but with flavors like that, who's looking anywhere but their plate?",0
"The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :)
This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)",0
"Went there for Dinner on a Friday night and I have to say I'm impressed by the quality of the food and the reasonable prices.  There's a great deal of variety and some creative New Mexican dishes.  I'd go so far as to say this is the best New Mexican restaurant in the East Valley!  Its not super spicy like Los Dos but there's a lot more flavor and you'll still feel the burn.

Pro's:  The Food and Service
Con's:  Ambiance & decor could use a little jazzing up, location is not ideal",0
"Qdoba is a kicked up version of Chipotle/Kokopellis.  You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill.  I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle.",0
"So Wednesday evening I needed milk and cat food. On my way to the store I realized my stomach was growling. Never a good idea to shop on an empty stomach. A while back in The Savvy Shopper rag in the China Grill ad was a little banner about Wok n Stix being a new location. And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in.

Chinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.

There was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner. They have had the place for 6 months and are the same family that owns China Grill not far away.",0
Excellent selection of unusual but delicious pizzas.  my favorite so far include prosciutto pizza and the lamb pizza,0
"What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.

It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. 

The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. 

The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.",0
"I went here with a friend to use a Groupon for a gel manicure and a spa pedicure. I knew it was a school going into the appointment. My issues with the place are as follows:
1. The students there were very unprofessional. They talked about their personal lives, talked to each other, and just were generally inappropriate for a business setting. Their supervisor overheard everything and did not say anything. This is pretty disturbing since some of these girls stated that they were going to work at places like Dolce in a few weeks. 
2. The gel manicure was billed as 'unchippable' by the people at this salon, but my friend had one whole nail peel off the day after the manicure and my nails chipped 2 days after. This is especially annoying because it is difficult to remove the polish that remained on my nails, so they just look bad. 
3. The massage was pretty weak. 
4. They don't have enough carts for pedicures, so I had to put my foot up on my 'pedicurist's' lap...that's a bit odd. 
5. It was difficult to make an appointment here. I had to call several times and leave messages and wait for them to call me back. 


Overall, I would not return to this place, even at the cheap price. I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"The beer list here is GREAT. Seriously. If you like craft brews, go here.

The food is meh. There are a lot of really interesting combinations, but the execution wasnt the best. The service is also meh. All 8 of us had to be wary when our waitress came around to tell her that so and so needed something too. She would take one or two orders at a time. 

Seriously though, the beer is awesome.",0
"Kabuki was great....A lovely little middle-of-the-afternoon oasis found in Tempe Marketplace!  I scoped out the menu had some some sushi for happy hour, including some rare beef sashimi, some unusual and unique rolls and complimentary edamame.  Although I did not dine here for a full meal, I feel justified in expressing my enjoyment of their happy hour.  The tiny bar was cozy and the service was good.  The happy hour prices were enticing and I would definitely return for it:)  Although for my personal taste the ambiance of Kabuki seemed a little too corporate for me I definitely would return for their happy hour and maybe to sample other menu items.  I will keep you posted on my next visit:)",0
"Ok...this place is *REALLY* outdated...HOWEVER, the food was great.  The Veggie plate was gone fast (barely got to taste any of it ... wife loved it) and my Gryo plate was very good as well.  This is the ONLY other place that I've been to where the Felafel was great!  I've been to only one other place...",0
"My wife and I live around the corner, hadn't eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out, Mongolian beef,kung po chicken,pad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!",0
"I know I enjoy food when I think about how good it was later..like days and days later. It has been about a week and I am still craving the Mac n' Cheese I inhaled during my Happy Hour visit. The Macaroni was cooked to perfection, the cheese was the perfect consistency and texture, and the addition of spicy sausage really set the dish apart. 

While the service was impossibly slow, every waiter I came in contact with was extremely nice. But nice or not, I was sucking on melted ice for half the night while I waited to get my drinks refilled. No bueno. 

The atmosphere was relaxing and casual, and the bathrooms were fabulous!! Well lit, great aroma, and my choice between cloth hand towels or paper. The bathroom had well placed mirrors which made the space feel big and clean.

I will definitely come back, but next time I might sneak in my own drink.",0
"- the location is excellent
- the food is mediocre, and milder than they advertise
- the wait staff is polite and bland.  At several opportunities, they were missing for more than 5 mins.
- the bill will be higher than anyone expects

Bottom line:  don't bother",0
"So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli. I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing. However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding. They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills. 

I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free. Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well. The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",0
"Large Goodwill location (formally a PetSmart), but dark like a cave. This one is hit or miss... It is clean for a Goodwill (I've seen some pretty dirty ones). Just need to keep checking to find the treasures here.",0
"Sandbar gives us North Scottsdalers another chance at a casual bar on our side of town!  Located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, Sandbar has a pretty convenient location and is usually a fun spot to go out dancing and drinking.  The DJ is either hit or miss; sometimes he plays awesome music and everyone's on the dance floor and other times the dance floor is completely empty because the music ain't so great. 
I've always wondered if anyone has become so intoxicated while at Sandbar that they have fallen into the little pond outside. Unfortunately, I have never seen this happen.
But I have woken up in the morning with a Sandbar server schedule in my pocket with no recollection as to why.
My friend was dancing so crazy one night on one of the platforms, that when she jumped off, she sprained her ankle. 
See? Sandbar's a really good time.
Oh and if you get hungry, there's a little hot dog cart out front, so you can eat a wiener, drink and be merry.",0
"My name is Amy and I'm a comedian.  (""Hi, AMY!"")  I perform here about once a month and it's one of my favorite spots to make people laugh.
This is a bar.  Behind an ice rink.  The wall behind the bar is the plexiglass of the ice rink.  One time, while I was on stage, a puck hit the glass.  Freaked me the you-know-what out.  I thought I'd been shot.  But I hadn't.  Lucky for you.
I don't drink, so I have no idea about specials, what's on tap, blah blah blah.
I can tell you this:  The service is amazing (and CUTE!) and the place is clean.  I judge.  I judge you on your bathroom.  This bathroom is clean.  
The comedy show is every Wednesday night.  It's free.  If you're lucky, you'll see me there.  Making people laugh.",0
"I like the review of the whacked waiter... i think he may be still at work at 'Cantina Laredo' cuz i think he served us....... 

Called ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10- 
"" No problem "" we were told , come on down. 

arrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F- 

Note to the great state of Arizona : 

(the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) .

we asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that "" he had already set a table for us inside""- 

upon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio  he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full. 

this puzzled my wife who then surmised that : 

A) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patio

B) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill 
                                      ( there was) 
                 
after taking our drink order ,(competently),  he returned with salsa and chips. The salsa he described as being of two types ""hot "" or ""regular""-
there were indeed two temperatures -but they appeared  to be seperated thermally rather than chemically -??  the same salsa one served at room temperature , one served chilled...???

when asked about the best dishes for people who wanted a little kick to their food he replied: 
"" I wouldn't really know , I don't like spicy food"" 

????????????????? 

Dude , can you not at least fake something.... it is after all a Mexican restaurant. If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non? 

The meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding.

The food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold--

Two stars tops over all but boosted up to three by our amigo from Victoria de Durango",0
"Whew!  What a hike.  Coming from Colorado, though, the relative comparison makes it just a 3.  

Firstly, it's definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). 

It was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.  If you go, just be wary of the sun/heat, and know that you'll be clambering over and around boulders and such.  (If you trip, it's CURTAINS!)",0
"My boyfriend and I tried this place out last Saturday. Our total was $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 beverages. Not bad for a lunch in Scottsdale. We found the burgers to be just OK tasting. Nothin special to lure us back anytime soon. I was satisfied with portions for $. I think people are used to ridiculous huge meals like the ones served at cheesecake factory which are big enough to feed a family of horses so when they see a normal single portion they feel underwhelmed/cheated. I found the restaurant to be clean and nice enough to sit & enjoy the burger & kill some time before our movie started.",0
"After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. 

As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)",0
"I read all the good reviews of this restaurant , and wanted to try it, as it's right up the street from where I live. I don't think I hit a bad night, it was slow, the service  was horrible, they confused our order with the table next to us.
 He  put  plates of food  down and walked off, the order had nothing to do with ours.
We tried to get his attention,gave up and took a bite.
OMG, it was AWFUL,fried fish that tasted so fishy that I couldn't eat it.
At that point, the table next to us realized it was their meal , and got up and walked out .
 Finally I got the waiters attention, he took the plates ,gave us the correct meal, and didn't offer to do anything about all of our time he had wasted, let alone the mistake. Our real meal was O.K., I tried the tamales, wasn't blown away,my boyfriend said his steak was so-so. I don't think I would come back again.",0
"I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.  

In the past I've had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.

My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it.",0
"As good as it gets.  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour, Eddie V's never lets you down!  Also, their Banana's Foster is divine!  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!",0
"Zupas officially opens today! I was invited to their VIP catering event a few days ago and was able to get a sneak peek. 

The soups are very good; I tasted all of them! My favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor. The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!

I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.

The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks!

The ingredients are fresh and the employee's are very friendly. 

They also cater which is a big plus!",0
"I'm still feelin the love. A most wonderful combination found I today of simple delightful food, a laid back atmosphere, warm staff, dog-friendly accommodations, a vegan-friendly menu and... oh yeah... all day Monday Happy Hour.  

Thank you TMI for the immediate bowl of water set down for my hound, the speedy $4 glass of red, and a yummy manageably-sized veg sandwich. I couldn't have asked for a better ending to this much dreaded Monday. It was lovely winding down and enjoying the sunset while other suckers waited in traffic.

I second Sarah G's enthusiasm for Sophie's salad sans mozzarella. Mmmm mmmm arthichoke. My next mission is the Cash Money sammie with house made cashew butter (wha?!) Cabernet jelly AND bananas. It's like Elvis met Sophia Lauren and decided to class it up. Soon will I be back to attempt such an adventure. Very soon.",0
"Brought my car in to get the electric stuff checked. $25 to do an electronic systems check, then determined it was a bad alternator. I brought my car in at the end of the day, about 5pm or so, and they had it ready by 11am the next day. 

The owner/manager, Terry, seemed like a straight up guy. Pricing is fair, as far as I could tell. 

They seem to stay pretty busy with normal cars as well as business fleet vehicles. I've seen school buses there, Topkick-sized trucks, and as well as your standard fare trucks with lawnmowers on the back.",0
"There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse.",0
"Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!",0
"Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!",0
"This is my favorite spa in the world! Hopefully, I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn, I'd be in heaven. Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best. Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room. Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured. I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.  If I have planned it, I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment. I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time, I reschedule.",0
"Bad service, great food, awful coffee.",0
"I'm usually a big fan of dive bars but wasn't impressed, at all.  One of the kegs was empty so my friends didn't get their ""favorite"" beer, not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a Friday.  The servers seemed really overwhelmed and was probably due to the fact that there were only 4 for the entire place and it was really busy.

On a very positive note, my friends said that the food was really good for bar food.

This might be a great place for any day and time other than happy hour on a Friday.",0
"This place is fantastic - very tasty and a nice surprise for the Tempe area.   Tempe seems to be full of places meant for those in college (makes sense because it is, in fact, a college town) - but for those of us who work in the are this is a nice break from the regular places.  I will be adding this to my list of lunch options. 

It is really nice when you are looking for a light salad or even quiche.  I would recommend this.",0
"I had been craving sushi steadily for about two weeks, so I decided to try somewhere new. This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. 

I had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.

My girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. 

The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. 

I would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok. The rainbow rolls at kobe are better.",0
"Meh.

Plus for cool decor. Minus for being in a strip mall (but hey it's Phoenix...)

Cinnamon Roll was good.  Awesome icing. Toluca Brizza was unique, but nothing spectacular.

it would be a good place for groups, with a vast menu (that i hear is very vegan friendly), but they are better places around town for brunch, both in terms of quality and price points.",0
"3 syllables for this place. 
A-MAZ-ING!

The best Phoenix has to offer.",0
"They have good baked baguettes and the price was $1.50 last month, however raising the price to $2 per roll during the holiday's is ridiculous.  The female cashier was short and unprofessional.  While i was waiting for the rolls, she was rude to the next three customers spending money.  They need to work on their customer service and I vowed never to go back.",0
"I came here after having wanted to try this place for some time.  I love hamburgers, and a good burger is a real treat for me.  Nothing complicated really, just a good well made burger.

When my date and I arrived, we liked the interior.  The place was smaller then I had anticipated.  Very narrow seating.  Anyways, service and menu selections were excellent.  I went with the traditional burger, and my date went with the Panini.  I went with the French fries, and date went with sweet potato.  I loved both.  The excitement of my night was the fries in the shopping cart!!

Anyways, I was happy with my experience here.  I would return, and liked my food.  So did date. Aside from tight seating, lovely place!",0
I've been coming here since the 70's when it was across the street and had a screen door. I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for. When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends. The whole family agrees. I don't understand the negative reviews. The reviewers must have had a bad day. I love the food and so has everyone  I know.,0
"It's not hard to find a steakhouse in Scottsdale.  Modern Steak's schtick is that it is... well, ""modern"" in the sense that it's not in a dark oak-filled room with overstuffed booths.  Unfortunately, however, ""modern"" also means that it's in a mall.  Ugh.

Pretty efficient (if not brusque) service, with decent enough food.  I had the salmon w/ maple and bacon glaze.  It's a bit of a bizarre combo -- I'm not sure the salmon quite holds up under such a sweet glaze, but you can't complain too much anytime bacon is involved :)",0
"The food and service were both amazing. I've had the gyro pita, orzo and greek potatoes. All were fantastic. Try the gelato also. It's the best in town! The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer.",0
"Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. 

I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. 

Breakfast: 

Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. 

Lunch:

Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.",0
"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.

Ok, I'll wait.

Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  That's when she said to us. ""Your table inside is ready""  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick!

We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though.

Awesome place!",0
We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time. We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids. My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know. Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips! Now I call that customer service. We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant. Looking forward to going back someday.,0
"It has been several months but I hadn't lost the formula (80/10/10 - veggies, meat, noodles).  Pat down some chicken-turkey (no taste difference as far as I can tell) with the wax paper.  Load up with mostly veggies (more green than red or white), add some wheat noodles to fill the bowl to the brim.  Follow with the sweet and sour mix but add some extra vinegar and orange sauce.  Add some pineapple and all set to have it grilled.  Fill a small bowl with peanuts and another small bowl with pineapple.  Fill the large red plastic drinking vessel with ice and low cal lemonade.  Then chow down...

My formula has more or less stayed the same since being introduced to YC's by Mike T and/or Erik T.  Both took different approaches and none tasted like the other despite selecting choices from the same line.  Amazing how three related people ended up with very different meals especially Erik T with cod fish and Mike T with who knows what kind of sauces except they were very dark.",0
"Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst.  A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me, assessed my problem, and quoted a very fair price to fix it. This guy was way too clean, personable and professional to be the plumber? He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time! You have to understand... I am use to a dirty, loud, intrusive  plumber that smiles with his butt!  These guys won me over and their telephone number 623-977-4458 is in my cell phone now.  I highly recommend Palmer's Plumbing!!!",0
"I had a nice lunch here on a hot summer day. $12 for a good pastrami sandwich with crispy seasoned fries and an iced tea. Definitely recommend the food.

Line was very short on a Friday afternoon. Soda machine ran out of ice, but they filled my cup with ice from ice maker in back and quickly filled machine with more ice.",0
"More like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because the overall property was so nice.

Good Food, Good Service, Good View (overlooking the golf course).

I had the Chicken Caprese sandwich which was quite tasty, but the burger my mom has was WAY better.  If you go here.... order a burger.  They are big, juicy and super duper good.  It's also super duper messy.  It's a ""fork and knife"" type of burger. 

Their bloody mary is pretty good... a little too tomato-y.... needed more seasoning.

Mom's John Daly Peach drink was refreshing.  Good for cooling off and relaxing after a round of golf.  :)

Tater Tots were served with our sandwiches and they were good... but nothing all that special.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside... but for this type of establishment.... I would have expectetd Truffle Tots or something different.

Their relishes that they offered on the side were 'ok'..... I was not impressed.  They tasted like they were from a bottle.... I'm sure they make their own relish... I'm just saying they didn't taste any different than the ones you get at the store.",0
"I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!

My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.

I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!",0
Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store. He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family. Thanks Alex!,0
"Go from brunch and get the breakfast nachos. OMG. They were to die for. red chile sauce, two cheeses, baked chips, chorizo eggs. Got sour cream on the side and left of the pico. Came with sausage gravy that was not the artery cloggin' kind. These were so yummy.

It was a little dark inside (full out front) and they don't have sweet & low. Nice ambience. Totally cool for the kids, too, but no paper kids menu.",0
"Sorry, I am gonna get killed here... I am not that impressed.
I kept hearing about this place and it was so so at best. The food is sloppy and very expensive but has a decent taste
The place was also a little dirty looking..
Just a bunch of sandwiches and the pizza was a disaster, go there if you are into quirky places that charge a lot and are not the best.
The waitress seemed pre-occupied by what?? not us.",0
"I love Chez Nous for the dancing, the live music is always great, but this past Friday I was really disappointed.  The cover charge has been raised to $7, the drinks were weak, and I got charged $9 for a Three Olives and Coke.  Combine that with being cash only so getting hit for $3 at the ATM inside the bar, and after one poor drink I was already at $20.  Maybe it's because I've gone back to being a broke college student, but I found the whole experience disappointing.  It seems like a few articles in the AZ Republic recently and the prices are flying through the roof.  So for now, I think I'm going to take a break from our relationship... sorry Chez Nous",0
"It's the place to be. 

I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.

Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.

My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal. 

We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.

Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back.",0
"Wow, not what we were expecting at all. But that's a good thing. The restaurant would qualify as a ""Dive"" in most circles, a tiny 20 seat affair with recycled refer units as cabinets located in the corner of a strip mall with a 99 cent store and a BigLots. Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.

But after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.

Every culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!

A kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.

Now this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.

Don't expect to find the standard ""Mexican Restaurant"" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.

We had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.

We also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.

To finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Crème Fraîche that was also a hit.

The owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.

As I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.

They serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.

Stop in, you'll be glad you did.",0
"While Scottsdale's Jackrabbit Supper Club is Britney Spears-approved -- the pop singer made the rounds last December when she reportedly made out with Arizona Cardinals hottie Matt Leinart -- it's a little too clubby for my taste. The music is usually loud, making it hard to carry on a conversation and nearly everyone looks like they stepped out of the pages of a fashion magazine. Oh, and be prepared to throw down more than the norm for drinks -- martinis are $13! If all of this isn't scaring you away, you'll probably have a good time. And the best part? The bar offers hourly burlesque-style performances from the club's saucy dancers.",0
"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat, hands down.  I love their enchiladas verdes combo.  Their refried beans are THE BEST!  I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same.  Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there.  Yes, it is in a bad area, but that hasn't ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good, real Mexican food at a great price, to head down there.  And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing.",0
"This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.

Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.",0
"Inexpensive, tasty, fast. The gentle peanut dressing on the pre-meal salad gets you started on a simple, no-frills meal with exactly one option from all of the classic dishes you expect at a Thai restaurant in America: massaman, red, green, yellow, or panang curry; pad thai or chowmein; meat or vegetable rice plates. There's nothing extravagant in spices or food choices, but you can order the spiciness level to you liking.",0
"I had been dying to try True Food Kitchen for a while now, after seeing reviews on it on various people's ""Vegetarian"" lists. I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!

I went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!

I ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!

We also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!

For my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was ""stuffed."" Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion. 

We definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.

The atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people ""off"" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.

We would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out. So... don't sit under the lights, if you can help it!",0
"flemings is always top notch. we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass. The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list. then to top it off we received $25 gift cards for dinner. so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for $39 the food was wonderful. salads, soup lamb chops and filet. i guess to sum it up you can't go wrong with a meal from flemings. they also have a great happy hour.",0
"oK, first i broke my promise to myself and went here again, i figured by now things have got to be better. i ordered something that i wouldn't care if it was cold, French Toast. ok so the french toast is good. but it wasn't worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it. and on top of it. my friends food was cold again. one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal, but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it i'll go.

well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash, his review of the place is more generious then mine, but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.

so anyways toast, soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash, lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?

i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast, but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.

can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast?",0
"Oh Yogurtland.....why can't I resist your calling?

I had to run an errand and saw this location next to a Fedex Office...perfect!  I dropped in and ordered:

Double Cookies & Cream, Strawberry, and Cheesecake...topped with Peanuts, Captain Crunch, and Reese's Peanut Butter Cup for around $4.90.

"Craving a noodle soup--thought I'd check this place after seeing the reviews.  Upon entering I didn't like the air quality, smelled like dirty deep frying oil.  Upon perusing the menu and looking around at other diners food, I realized it was mostly composed of tempura, duh, deep fried.  Yikes, I am not a fan of deep frying but that explained the smell.   I opted for the shrimp udon soup.  It wasn't anything near the wonderful soup I had experienced elsewhere, especially this great Japanese restaurant in Chiang Mai that had this amazing moat around the sushi chefs were they would float the sushi on little boats that you could pick and choose.  Very disappointing, broth, noodles, spinach, green onion and 2 shrimp, $8.  I did get an added bonus of deep fat smell covering my clothing.",0
"This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Fresh bagels and different types of cream cheese.

They even have Bagel Thins for those who are cutting their carbs. 

You don't pay the person who took you order, but move down the line to pay for your food.

Their iced coffee are a great deal!! It's a 20oz cup for less than $3!",0
"I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.

The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait.",0
Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.,0
"Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the ""boneless buffalo wings"" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu ""the Wendy's pickle sandwich"" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is ""the big WAC"" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!",0
"This is a must try for any Mani Pedi fan. I use to drive to Scottsdale for all of my services until I found this spot. Get the pedi, no metal file pedi once - and you will NEVER go any where else. Have fun. I do..Customer service - top end. Thanks",0
They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.,0
"I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!  

Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. ""It looks interesting"" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top. 

We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night. 

I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.  

Thank you Jason and Switch.",0
"I've been here a couple of times when I was in college, and once or twice since I've graduated. A memorable time while in college was my friends 21st bday on a Thursday night I came here on a party bus with some people (including some guy from the Real World) and they had a fountain of champagne with strawberries. All you can drink is definitely a bad idea for me because I felt the wrath and had to call into work the next day. But it was a whole lot of fun! Recently I came here with my bf and some friends and I must say I had a great time. I was happy to have a little more than annoying house music all night. They played a wide variety of music that was fun to dance to. I also loved the pussycat dancer that dances above the DJ, it's pretty cool when the two way mirror reveals a bed and sexy burlesque dancer! The bartenders are pretty cool and I didn't have to wait very long to get service. I think PCL is a decent bar based on my experiences.",0
The only place I go for a nice lunch on Mill. Two words: Beet Salad. Thank me later.,0
"New to the Scottsdale area, I've been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks. I stumbled upon this place and was very happy. Although it's in a weird strip mall, it's really relaxing inside. My gel manicure was perfect, and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra! Totally recommend!",0
"The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.

I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:

Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, ""sorry, we don't serve your type here."" Mushroom says ""why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy).""",0
"It's the middle of January and 75 degrees out.  While there's no shortage of things to do outside, there aren't many dog-friendly places for that where you can sit down and eat.
Jacqui J and I took out doggies to the dog park.  They're bruthas, you see, and hadn't hung out in awhile.  We had MLK day off together and spend the afternoon together.  Trying to decide where to eat with the pooches, I thought of TMI because I had seen so many people recently check in on Yelp.  
Their patio is pretty big and mostly shaded.  This wasn't a day to be too concerned about shade, since it wasn't hot out.  I read the reviews ahead of time and already knew what I wanted before I even got there.  I was happy to have to take home a doggie bag, too.  
I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and don't always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.  They came in a little bowl, but there were about 20 of them.  The red goat salad was perfect: tons of pistachios on it, big chunks of goat cheese and strawberries.
And den...and den...the mac and cheese, generously stuffed with chopped green chiles, ooey-gooey melted cheese that was crusty on the edges, the way it's supposed to be.
I'll be back with Dexter.  They gave him a treat.  Oh, and my meal was treat.  I'm burping up the leftovers as I type this.",0
I only go for the movies or when I know what I'm getting.  Not much of a shopper but I remember having fun here when I still lived in L.A. and came to visit.,0
I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.,0

"I've always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa aren't good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, I'm super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest.",0
Probably one of the better gay bars in town.. friendly.. decent crowd.. reasonable prices.. after hopping from one to another this place was our favorite. Lots of furry muscle bears too! Nice!!,0
"Great new addition to Mill Ave. 

First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)

Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming. 

(sidenote: every bartender / waitress I've dealt with here has been really, super nice.)

Def. worth a shot I'd say, and I could see it being a fave HH place.",0
"I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!  

I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!",0
"just say no.

this place is truly awful. 
too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe.",0
"I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!! 

If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.",0
"Always wanted to stop by, and give them a try. Only thing that stopped me were some bad rumors of how clean they are? But then again, how clean is all the places we eat at?? So I had their 8"" Meat Ball sandwich, this was my second choice? I wanted was their cheese steak! But they were out of cheeses steak. But I do not regret their meat ball sandwich. It was very good, wish their bread would have been more toasted. But I thought it was good anyways. Place looks like and feels like a lot like Subway. But I do agree, they do add more meat to the sandwich. I will probably come back again.",0
"Sacks is a great little place.  One issue and I know this wouldn't seem like a bad thing (at least if you are the owner) but it is a bit too busy for me.  I can never find a parking place or a seat.  The sandwiches are good and I like them, but I will admit that sometimes I don't go just because of the crowds.  

The food is good.  I like that they have a variety of sandwhiches and they put a lot of things on the sandwiches which can easily be taken off for the picky folks like me unlike other places where things are mixed in and not removable.  If you are looking for a good tastey sandwhich, this is a great place to check out.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat, move along.",0
I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things. Well one night when we were kidless we went. It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived. We were both very impressed. Warm homemade bread. Awesome salads. I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers. We will definitely go back!,0
"tried this place due to a restaurant.com gift certificate, 4 stars for service, we had an awesome and attentive server which made it great for first visit. drinks were good. went with friends and did some sharing to try the different dishes we ordered. the salmon quesadillas was on the fishy side, the pollo relleno good but a little dry and didnt get the poblano and goat cheese flavors that drew me to choosing the dish, the cilantro mousse sounded more interesting on the menu but was cream cheese and cilantro, the Obama burrito was the winner on our table though. great salsa. would come back and try other dishes and tae in some live music.",0
"This is an open-air mall.  Unlike most malls which are totally enclosed, this mall is outdoors.  In the outdoor area they sometimes have ""events"".  The Batman ""Tumbler"" was there for a day once, we've heard concerts here, and this last visit they had a sculling team there with their boat.

They have many of the usual shops (American Eagle, Gap, Aeropostale, Victoria's Secret, etc).   The Harkins Theater hear is pretty nice.  We like the Genghis Grill for food (see my review of them).  The Paradise Bakery is nice also.  There are several other eateries here, but we haven't tried most of them yet.  However, several choices are available.

This is a nice mall to just wander and shop, and eat and drink, and enjoy whatever is going on.",0
"Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks! 

Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.

He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.

Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????",0
"Came here for lunch recently with active Yelper and friend Brett B. I'm sure he'll post up his own review of the place.

This is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. You also get your glass and go fill 'er up at the fountain yourself. I wasn't sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute I asked ""how big is the salad"" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. That was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a ""size"" with their hands and shrug and say, ""i don't know... about like this?"" So, yeah. I like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a ""mound"" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad. 

When I ordered ""just water"" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, ""you know what? Just take a regular glass, it's more comfortable...."" He trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and I did only drink water). That was nice, and made me feel like an adult. Not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor's office, when you order water.

I really enjoyed my lunch here - Had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because I'll never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza.

The caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was ""perfect"" . The portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. The chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes SUCH a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. It was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. And the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. Nice touch. Excellent flavor, every mouthful.

The cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary.

Granted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, I'm spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonno's in NYC's upper east side. But still, darn good. I'd eat it again. (I took some home and it didn't look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it).

Brett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. I think it had pine nuts too. I got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. Either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. Delicious. 

And the service was great! The  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals. 

Great food - great service - great vibe. I hope this place sticks around. 

Definitely would eat there again. Looking forward to it, even!",0

"Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor, wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion.",0
"This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?

So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. 

Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.",0
"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.

The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, ""nope that's what green looks like"".  WOW!

Sorry but I don't think I will be returning.",0

"I used to come here about once a week for their amazing vegetarian sandwiches. My favorite is the griefo with pepper jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The hemp cream cheese is to DIE for seriously! I also enjoy the humbolt, which is very similar, and the majic mushroom with sliced portabella mushrooms, teriyaki glaze, green bell peppers, pineapple and pepper jack cheese. The 8inch is soo big but makes a great and filling lunch. You can't beat the prices either. Get the garlic herb bread, it is the best. The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole ""marijuana"" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make. Staff is usually pretty friendly and social though. One last thing is that if you eat there or have to wait for a while your clothes will smell like food :/",0
"This dry-rub barbecue was delicious. The ""sassy"" barbecue sauce was meh, but the sweet was good enough to make up for it.",0
"The Vig was just okay in my opinion.   I met some friends there for happy hour  on a Friday evening and it was packed.   We did get the drinks/app specials, and all the food we tried was just okay.  The atmosphere was your standard trendy bar/meat market. (i.e. A lot of people trying waaaay to hard to look and act cool.)  We had a good time, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back there anytime soon. The people I was with we're great, but The Vig  itself was 'meh'...certainly nothing special.",0
"Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I don't care for.

There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before.

I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for.

Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure.",0
"As an artist, I've come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies. Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store!!! Every time I visit I overhear the staff's experienced recommendations; they take the time to ensure that every customer's needs are satisfied. 

I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and well-organized aisles. Yes, this is my kind of art supply store!  As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint, easels and canvases to ceramic tools, an overwheming desire to create comes over me. AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brands--Prismacolor and Golden Paints!  

Although this store is smaller, the prices are reasonable--they beat out Michael's prices for nearly every item. If you're looking for exceptional quality, a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff, Arizona Art Supply is your best bet.",0
Our visit to Scottsdale brought us into Fountain Hills to look for a home. While we were there we decided to look at the beautiful fountain we heard so much about. That's when we happened upon this place. The pizza was fantastic!!! It made us want to move here even more. Delicious!,0
"We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu. 

The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright. 

We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-2 were super spicy and other's 4-5 weren't that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest) 

Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot.",0
"We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just don't seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just can't afford those prices for what you get.",0
"So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!

They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food. 

Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup (""Yum-O"" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice! The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent. Our family of five finished nearly everything. :D so GOOOOOD! Going to come back soon! 

Check this place out!",0

"I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.

First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him. 

The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets? 

The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed.",0
"They have high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls, and I like that.

Regarding the Chicken Pad Thai. The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly, but the noodles were a bit chewy.

Spring rolls were great. The pic on the menu shows them served in halves, but they arrived at our table whole.

My date had their Thai noodle bowl, and Id suggest skipping on the beef balls.  Also, its very bland if you order with no spice.

The owner recommended that we vacation in Thailand.  He also offered to install new granite flooring in out home.  Travel agent, mason, restaurateur.  He does it all.",0

Anyways.

There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.

I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good.",0
"Decentfood, but horrible service. Both servers walked by me three times while I was sitting inside without acknowledging me at all. I was by myself and felt as though everyone else that came walking in were immediately welcomed.  I wish I would have received the same attention. I was ready to walk out when i was finally approached. Nobody came back to check on me to make sure everything was ok after they delivered my food. Being from Vegas I am not accustomed to such non attentive service staff. I guess that flys here in Scottsdale, but I expected more from the type of clientele that they have. On a positive note, they do have a cozy place that gives the feel of a French coffee shop/bistro. Hopefully this review will be helpfull in giving them insight into making sure that every guest is treated with the same attentiveness to service.",0
"A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) 

We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.

We both had wine, the ""single glass"" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)

Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!

We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. 

I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. 

There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.

Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.",0
"An interesting concept that didn't end up being what I hoped for.  

I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.

The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.

Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.

Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.

Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.

Okonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat

Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily

The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.

The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.",0
"I love Victoria's Secret, but this store has a terrible selection, and the employees are rude here.  I have visited many locations all over the U.S., and was not happy with this one. They were very pushy about trying to get me to buy bras that I did not like as I only buy a certain style of bra from here.  I also thought that there selection of PINK merchandise was severely lacking.",0
"I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.",0
"Love it.

Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.

It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.  

When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.

I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.

Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm.",0
"I have been coming here for the past 4 years; the pizza and food are great.  The service has been very good, some seasonal workers and some regulars.  I bring friends from out of town here for good pizza and wings.  I would recommend it any time.",0
"Just a quick review to get the ball rolling. Popped in here on opening night, and was pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker ""Modern Thai"" has become euphemism for ""Expensive Thai."" I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce.",0
"One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80. diagnosis fee and split.  Francisco told me i needed to spend over $1300. for parts the manufacturer only charges $316 for. Stay away! I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today, hopefully they will stop this nonsense.",0
"I love the kitsch of this place! Bears bears everywhere! Black Bear Diners are usually found in small to medium sized towns, but for some reason this one is smack in the middle of urban sprawl. So not complaining though, because it means I don't have to drive to the middle of nowhere to enjoy their old-timey newspaper-menu and awesome pot roast! 

Their fare is strictly comfort food and always well-prepared. The full portions will fill an average 200lb guy, so it's nice that smaller folk like myself have the option of getting the small (or ""senior) portion! 

Save room for their personal-sized pies...you won't regret it!",0
"this another place that i would give no stars to if possible. 
it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.

i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.

after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.

seriously, I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?",0
"I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.

First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.

Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.

Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.

Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   

Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.
No value

Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.
My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.

Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.

Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!",0
"We have tried every Chinese delivery in Chander over the past few years and have found them all to be barely edible...and we aren't picky eaters. Honestly, fellow Yelpers, we even didn't like the one's you gave 4 stars. Where's the flavor? We tried Asian Grill delivery tonight - wonderful...delicious! We finally found excellent Chinese food delivery in Chandler!",0
"1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.",0
"My Fiance and I went here today for the first time. We shared a meat pie
and a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish. 
     ALL of it was amazing. I cannot speak highly enough of their food. Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick. The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated. All over, the ambiance was pleasant. I look forward to returning!",0
"I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent ""manhood"" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.

There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...""Asshole"".

He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...""vote with your feet""...but I guess that's another review.

The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!

At the very tippy top of the ""near and dear"" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.

Whit is a Vegan...with a capital ""Vege""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.

So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!

I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!

I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!

We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!

Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!

The big question about Green is ""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?""

I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.

I like to ""fit in"".

The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.

I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).

I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!

I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!",0
I have since revisited the store several times and I would be remiss if I didn't update my rant.  Debbie the owner has been friendly and helpful ever since I asked nicely.  I suppose with the amount of lookie loos or window shoppers in Old Town I can relate to the lack of enthusiasm.,0
"Buckle is a really cool store.  They carry both men and women's clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans.  From Silver to Lucky, they're all there!  

They also have really cute tops- from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar.  It's nice because this store has its own style...kinda casual, a little funky, but definitely different than anything you'd find at Macy's or Nordstrom's.  

They also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful.  You'll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches, you'll get $10 or $15 off.

The clothes range in price, but generally, I'd say everything in the store is pretty reasonable.  This location is in Paradise Valley Mall- check it out!",0
"I'll agree that this is a great meet up place in the city. Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and I'd come back to try more but here's what our first visit was like.

As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back.

My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. I'm talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, it's one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Here's what it reads for the ""meat"" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ];

So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro. 

But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least. 

Yes, I'm bitter.",0
"Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!",0
"Kind of cold, otherwise your typical Paradise Bakery. Delicious chicken Caesar salads.",0
"I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good.",0
"Who woulda thunkkkk Scottsdale, AZ would have such amazing soul food??! They surprised the hell outta me!

Coming from someone who regulars Roscoes chicken &waffles... believe me when I say LOLO's is BOMB!!! 

I got the 3chicken combo... w greens, mac&cheese &cornbread.
 
Cornbread.. hands down Roscoes!
Greens... Roscoes
Mac&cheese... LOLOs for suuuree!
Chicken... tied.. they're both really good!

the staff is super friendly!! can't wait to go back when i visit AZ. (=",0
"So, yea. Kelly's review has me more than a little concerned.  Thinking we won't go back for awhile. Most likely quite awhile.  I'd rather be sure they have that crap taken care of.  Literally.

But here's why we'll still end up going back.  It's all about 3 things.  It's conveniently located.  It makes you feel like you're eating healthy (Note - doesn't really encourage healthy eating, more just a healthy attitude.  Keeps the brownies, chocolate pudding, pizza and mayo based salads in large supply) And then finally - Coupons.  They have coupons ALL the time.  ALL the time.  

Special note - if you aren't that hungry - don't go here.  Go somewhere else where you can split your meal or take 1/2 home.  Here that 1/2 a plate of salad greens is going to cost you just as much as the guy on his 4th plate.",0
"If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you- I felt like I was in the 1980- the decor LITTERALLY says it all.. I kid you not, I am as frugle as the come and you get & more than you pay for here -($3.00 everyday except for tuesdays $1.50)
have I mentioned the minnie arcade? Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door ...",0
"Until Bobby Q's entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything! made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digress...This place has changed my life for the better!. Their St. Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING! and their Mac n Cheese is a must have! I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob, if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.

A short review but you get the gist of it...",0
"WOW this place is good!  SO good!  And not just yummy good, but intrinsically good.  Check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - http://essencebakery.com/essence_bakery_environmentally_friendly.shtml !  

That, and it's cute.  And it tastes Yummy!  And they are SO nice!  SOOO nice!  And their deserts are just disgustingly cute and beautiful and freaking good.  I almost bought the mini box of 4 cupcakes for just $3.50.  Bite sized so not too bad, but if I bought them today they'd be gone before I got home. 

I got their grilled cheese w/ mozzarella, basil and tomato on grilled buttery brioche bread with a light and tasty green salad on the side.  It will be hard to not come here every week.  I love that all the drinks are refillable - and it's up to you to refill them.  Coffee, tea or soda, just walk on up and fill your glass.  And I love that it's all so fresh and local!  

Important note - You order at the counter, they give you a number and bring out your food.  If you're paying w/ debit card, they will ask you if you want to include a tip.  That threw me.  I'd been in the place less than 2 minutes - how do I know if it's worth the tip - or how much of a tip it's worth??  Bring some cash or plan to deal w/ that question accordingly.",0
"What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot ""warm"" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back.",0
"This place is great!   I've eaten here twice now and both times the food has been wonderful.  I've driven by this place for years and it always looked closed to me.   The windows are very dark.   My husband's barber told him his customers (the barber's) drive all the way from Scottsdale to eat here.    We decided to try it out after hearing this and reading good reviews about it on Yelp.   The first time we went for dinner.  I had the Osso Bucco and my husband had Seafood Paella.   Both were great.  I've had  Osso Bucco in high end restaurants that couldn't compare to this.   The second time we ate here for lunch.   Husband had the Philly Cheesesteak with Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.   I had some of his sandwich and we both agreed it was the best Cheesteak we've ever had.  The sandwiches are loaded with fillings and are not salty.   Spaghetti and Meatballs were good but I like Babbo's and Humble Pie's better.    I would have given it five stars but the atmosphere is not the best.   Our first waiter even told us they do have the reputation for being a hole in the wall.   The service is very casual with no sense of urgency.  On our second visit for lunch our waitress told us she had been there over five years and they have quite a few regulars.    Both times we have visited the restaurant was almost full.    Try this place out even though it is a ""hole in the wall.""",0
"Jersey Mike's is okay. It's a chain place, and a bit over priced for fast food.  I ordered a philly cheese steak.  It was mostly bread, with a few thing microscopic slices of meat.  A little cheese too.  And a sliver or two of peppers.  But mostly, it was bread.  I think it's funny the people that work here try to make small talk with you.  ""So, what are you guys up to tonight?""  I think it would be fun to just try and f*#k with them, and say something like, ""Oh you know, smoking a little meth and just chilling with some hookers.""  See what they say to that.",0
"I have been here a few times, but mainly at dinner.  Dinner Has always been great, great waiters and staff, with a LCD TV playing almost famous famous bolywood movies.  LOL  It cracks me up when they dance.....LOL...anyhow, Great vegetarian choices for people who eat there veggies, but trust me, I am a MEAT eater,  Chicekn Tika masala, Little dry but still good.  My favorite is there Palak Paneer. Great for the vegetarian.  I have also tried there lunch Buffet for 11.00.  I give a Thumbs up..  Good, serve yourself, and pig out!!!!!!",0
"I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasn't available that day.  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.  The waiter had major attitude.
Avoid this place!",0
"I have friends that I meet there once a month for a delicious greasy spoon breakfast and these guys never disappoint.  I am a breakfast maven so love their hash browns most of all.  If I'm feeling a little decadent, I order a side of gravy with them.  It's really nice to sit outside during the cooler months and have some fries and a shake too!",0
Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!,0
"I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.  

I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.  

The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.

I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.",0
"I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times. I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices. This place uses local farms for their produce, safe from GMO's and pesticides. So, I was already a fan before I walked in! Everything I have tried has been delicious, and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers. The food always tastes so fresh, and full of flavor! They have a little something for everyone. I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions. We always both leave happy. I definitely recommend this place. I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time! :)",0
One of my regular buffet stops. great service and average food.,0
"We received a Netflix subscription from our daughter for Christmas along with a Roku box. We have the streaming stuff. The video and audio quality is very good (almost as good as a dvd).
However---many of the things we would like to see are on DVD only and that would DOUBLE the monthly cost of Netflix (UNACCEPTABLE).
Many of the streaming programs are FREE on Crackle and Hulu (not to be confused with HuluPlus which charges).
Overall, it is OK but I'm not sure that we will spend the $96/year when our gift subscription is over since a lot of this content is out there for free.",0
"Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order.",0
"Nice resort located next to the Desert Ridge shopping complex.  If you're from out of town, this would be a great place to stay since you'll be across the street from a ton of restaurants and bars.

I went to an event here, and haved stayed here a few times.  JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that I've gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need.

The rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy.  The bathroom was nice as well.   The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views.

The pool area is where it's at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when you're feeling better.  Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend.   It's not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, it's no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on.",0
Great brewery and open atmosphere!  Had the Buffalo Chickens sandwich.  It was great.  Washed it down with a Sunspot Golden Ale which was awesome.  Will return to sample the other beers.  Making a reservation online worked like a champ.,0
"I'm going to break this down to explain my two stars. Here we go.

THE GOOD: 
* Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. 
* Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere
* Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.

THE BAD:
* Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why.
* A surly ""aunty type"" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids
* Said ""aunty type"" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait.
* Said ""aunty type"" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes.
* Said ""aunty type"" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh?
* Said ""aunty type"" doesn't say ""thank you"", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.

THE UGLY:
* Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? 

So, in the end, here's the equation:

1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars.

"My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.",0
"Spa whore, I am! I work in the industry, live in the industry and have breathed the industry for the last 5 years so I know spas. After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My ""corner"", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.
Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. 
After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.
After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.
I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.
I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!
I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.",0
"Kinda of a rough and tumble crowd at times with the OTB booth in the back corner of the bar. Place is usually crowded after work with the blue collar drinking types and unless your a regular you will probably get ignored like I did on a previous visit. In this case, finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good. The waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good, so I went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese, lettuce, some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon? THe wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together. On the side dish selection wheel, I went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety, but the raspberry sauce? served as a dipping option was a fail. Great service on a saturday afternoon and reasonable prices ($8.99) for a filling lunch.",0
"It does not get much better than this, fellas.

BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.

Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.

Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday. 

Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.

It definitely has a ""Cheers"" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.

Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007.",0
"I was severely mislead by Frank A's, ""It's hot, but the food ain't bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.",0
I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!,0
"Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try! 

Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of. 

Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge ""by the glass"" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!  

The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them! 

My one complaint is petty: their website.  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!",0
"I love the food!! Love for the environment.. eh.. not so much.

Mom and I missed our reservation at Cowboy Ciao's on a Friday night and a worker recommended us to visit the sister restaurant ""Kazimierz."" Ok, we'll go as long as they have the famous Stetson Chopped salad. My mom loved the salad when she went to Cowboy Ciao.

So we enter the restaurant and the place is so dark. How the heck are you suppose to find a table and read the menu?? We had no idea how the seating worked, so we asked a worker. We were seating within a couple of minutes. Mann.. we had to hold up the candle to read the menu. The environment is nice if you are just spending time with your friends and chatting. But to eat and see your food?? The darkness is not good for that.

Anyway, we had the Stetson Chopped salad ($12). It was sooo good with the smoked salmon, dehydrated corn, pepita mixture, and the greens. Yummy!

The Burgundian Flatbread ($13) was also delicious! I liked the crispy crust and the chunks of brie!! Wow!! The morels and the shallots gave the flatbread some sweetness.

Since I liked the food, I'll give this place 4 stars. However, I wish I could see what I was eating. Thank goodness I took a picture of what I was ingesting. 

The service and atmosphere is more like 3 stars.",0
"Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...",0
I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!,0
"I have been coming to this bar for over 4-years now - and I will continue to do so...  Just be aware that this is no longer ""J Chew & Company"".

Originally, when it was called ""J Chew"" I fell in love with the place - it had a cool underground loungy charm. It was the best place to meet new and interesting folks. Now it is known as ""Old Town Tavern"" and has more of a generic sports pub theme that is dominated by TVs. The crowd is slightly older and the bartenders aren't as wild/fun... Not a great place to take a date any more.

On the upside: The place is much cleaner now, has live music almost every night, and Tuesday movie-night has some serious potential. Check it out for yourself.",0
This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.,0
"I didn't eat here, so I guess I can't give a full review. But I did have a beer, and I did take the Orbit to downtown Tempe, and I walked over here and had a yummy pint for 2 bucks on Sunday evening. 
The more places that I can drink then take a bus home, the better.",0
Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!,0
"Yelp has failed me...I went here based on the reviews I found on here, only to find a restaurant that has fallen off from what it used to be. 

I guess this use to be a chef driven restaurant, he created a name for the place. But whatever it is now it has definitely fallen off and definitely not good. 

The space is nice enough, I really did not enjoy sitting at the bar and have to look at there dirty kitchen the whole time...But the place does offer a pleasant enough atmosphere. 

The food on the other hand was bad. I had the tasting of the appetizers in which everything was overcooked (mushy eggplant) or overcooked and Burnt (anything that had bread like potential) I kinda of wanted to leave after this but I had ordered my Salmon entree from the start... 

And now on to the entree which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on the top, and RAW skin underneath, did not make any since to me. it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate. 

The menu and idea of this restaurant is great, sharp contrasts and bold flavor, but the technique and care is definitely lack here, or maybe they just had a shitty cook that day, I don't know, I just know that I will never make my way back there.",0
"What the crap folks? So much ""blah blah blah"" ""this place is so great"" spewing from Yelpers and the media that I felt like I was missing out.  I finally went to this damn place and I guess I am missing the point because this was a joke.

Their menu has all of about 5 things on it.  Most of them seem reasonably priced until you see their size.  I ordered the Vampiro because it sounded good, had guac, carne asada, and was portrayed as a quesadilla type meal.  Ya, this thing was like the size of a Kennedy half dollar - and half as filling!  What the hell? $4 for this?  I can't even taste the guac!!

If I want cheap good mexican food, I guess I'll stick with 'Bertos because this place is a disaster.  At least at 'Bertos I can get more than 5 items and the burritos are Soviet-car-sized.",0
"Fabulous place.  The food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice.  Love the butcher shop and Jerry the Cellarmaster is abslutely fantastic.  Seriously, if you want a bottle of wine - he is the best resource.  And if you go back frequently he tailors his suggestions to what you like.  My favorite thing about this store is that the staff tries so hard to treat you like a valuable customer.  They remember your name, ask after your kids and honestly act like they like you.  It feels like a small town grocery store and I love that.   Breakfast is fantastic and the coffee is great.  Everyone at the coffee counter is terrific.  This was a really great addition to the neighborhood.",0
"I don't like mega-chain pizza.  I don't like Domino's.  I don't care for Papa John's.  I've never had Hungry Howie's because frankly on their flyers it looks horrifying.  And I will never ever eat Little Caesar's again in my life . . . but I gotta admit, Pizza Hut makes a decent thin crust pizza

There were a few great locally owned pizza joints where I used to live in Tempe.  Tessio's and Boulders On Broadway stand out, but ya know what?  Sometimes you don't want to pay $20 $25 bucks for an extra large 3 topping pizza.  Sometimes you just want something decent for only $10 $12 bucks.  Sometimes you really DO want a decent cheap pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less

The three years I lived nearby, I probably ordered Pizza Hut delivery or takeout once every couple of months, and I've never had anything to complain about at this location on Broadway

PS - the boneless spicy bbq wings are dangerously addictive",0
"Cibo!   Eating outside is a major part of the experience even on a hot summer night in Phoenix!  Worth the dampness from head to toe.  The BONUS is sitting under the African tree with the lights and grapes with the FULL moon shining on us  ~

Our red haired waiter sporting 1950's style glasses was fun, fun, fun and pleasingly attentive.   We had white wine;  superb choice thanks to the 4 different wine tastes I received while choosing it.  

The strawberry/walnut salad was a bit dry, yet the feta was marvelous!  Great soft texture to melt in your mouth.  

The pizza was the sausage and it was wood fired, nice and perfect.  Just enough food for the 3 of us ~

So much food, just the right amount for our bellies.  For the 3 of us, the bill was only $43.00.  Not too bad on a Saturday night to go in 1/3's.

~ Luana Joya Lucia",0
"Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it best

Actually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...

Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say ""you mean the one in Scottsdale"" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back...",0
"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.

well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. 

it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...

our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'

then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.

i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. 

we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. 

as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. 

awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. 

if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.",0
"4.5 stars

Ok....I just had the most amazing facial there today....I never experienced anything like it.  And my pedicure rocked also.

I don't think I picked a better day to have a little relaxation.  I rode almost 24 miles today (I swear it was all uphill) and I had the worst pain in my legs.  (Yes, I did stretch)  

My pedicure was great...Shannon does a wonderful job....though now I have straight line syndrome with french man/pedicures.  Since I hate it that they have to use latex gloves, I couldn't tell at all that she was wearing them when i was getting my massage.  AND!  She actually made my feet completely soft and dry skin free.  That alone is a miracle.  

Then I had my amazing facial.  Where do you get a facial that they put your hands in parrafin wax, massage your legs (I did complain about my pain....) and give the most relaxing neck, shoulder, and head massage ever?????  Laura is amazing...and she does a great job with waxing also.  

I found out today that you don't have to be a member of Lifetime Fitness to go there...and I did hear another rumor that rocks...but I don't know if I should say it here....",0
"The Vig is a great place to meet up for a drink. I haven't found too many other places that serve Hoegaarden (my favorite beer). The atmosphere is one of the best I've seen in Phoenix, and the food is pretty good as well. I'd recommend the ""Big Azz Burger"" or the ""Hot Vings""!",0
"absolutely love this place. It is a fru-fru hang out joint that isn't pretentious. 

The cucumber lemonade has become my favorite non-alcoholic drink and their bruschetta is always the best!",0
"Our company held our fourth annual user conference here, and compared to our previous venues, this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.

The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.

The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.",0
"Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed.",0
"It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game.

But service sucks. I don't understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service. 

I wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place.",0
"Jimmy Johns has got to be my guilty pleasure. Love the Beach Club and the salt and vinegar chips. This location is fairly new and it does the JJ chain well. Although they do keep the music louder than I'd like. Great place, great sandwiches.",0
"I have been to St. Francis twice - once for brunch and once for dinner. The brunch deserves 5 stars, we had great service and great food. Their bread was AMAZING! We had great service for dinner, but the food wasn't up to what I was expecting. Things were a little bland and the sauces on all the dishes was a little heavy. However, overall I would definitely recommend them.",0
"Always here for their California burritos... The burritos are huge and can be easily shared by two people.  Their jalapeno and carrots are somethin I havent seen at other similar places, id recommend it if you,re lookin for some heat! The drive thru service is fast and friendly.  I have seen they did remodel the inside seating and does not look as,roughed up as before... There is a drawback when using your card to pay- 50¢ addtl charge, which shud b done away with.",0
"I like Bungalow because its a great starting point for a night in Old Town Scottsdale. Centrally located, any other watering hole is in short walking distance, keeping the options open. 

Making this bar/grill the main location for your night out might pose some problems:
-the drink prices are mediocre at best, so don't expect to be frugal.
-the staff aren't anything special.
-I didn't even know they served food, so it can't be better than average.
-unless you can drop a pretty penny (and look the part) don't expect any good conversation.

I can appreciate what this establishment is good for though. Bungalow offers a nice atmosphere to sit and converse with friends (not many locations in Old Town offer the ability to hear normal conversation)...",0
"This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works.",0
"Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.

Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too.

Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.

Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, they're open until 12am EVERY night.",0
"Horrendously overpriced. ~$13 for an xlarge 2 topping that I had to bake myself? The pizza itself was better than average, but if you don't bake on location then at least make it cheaper than going to pizza hut and having it delivered to my door, ready to eat.

I'm glad I had the experience, but I don't see where the benefit to this is, at all. It isn't more cost-effective than going to the grocery for frozen pizza, and it isn't that much better than frozen.

On the plus side, the gal at the counter that made my pizzas was very nice, but it's a shame I don't see this kind of business surviving. I probably won't return, I am pretty disappointed.",0
"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!",0
My buddy and I (along with our dogs) stop by here every morning on the way to dog park. Hot coffee and hot women making the coffee! Love this place!,0
"This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!

Drinks
1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice. 
2. If you bring in your own ""pimp cup"" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.

Food
1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing.
2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.",0
"No cover and outdoor misters. Decent crowd, overpriced drinks, teeny dance floor, good selection of d'bags to giggle at. It's A.) a club, B.) in a chain hotel, C.) in Scottsdale, fer chrissakes. What more could you ask for? My only hangup was how dark they keep it in there. People in Scottsdale are generally good looking, so a little more lighting in there isn't going to hurt business one bit. 
Overall... this place doesn't feature anything that really stands out.",0
"Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.",0
"HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October)
it hurts my lungs to breath.

I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay.
The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!!
~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*

I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education.
I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.

For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.

Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition.
Very little hands-on and help with internships.
Way too much groupwork and free-riding.
They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.

Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses.
They have their teaching assistants teach us.

Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.
 Junior year when you get admitted into the ""professional program"" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.

The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)

There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes.
The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.

Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college.
Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.

Expect to wait in line wherever you go.
ASU accepts way too many people.
It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.

Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.
The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.
They are not informed enough to advise you.

I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.
I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.

Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.
Gross!!

One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.

The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.

ASU is not the most safe neighborhood.
I have been approached by many shady people.

do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus.
They are beyond crappy and overpriced.
You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads.
The ""freshman year experience"" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it.
and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).

I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.

Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student. 
Hope this helps.",0
"Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does.

"I'm not a fan of ice cream, I just don't find it appealing and it's too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically it's much less fattening, yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoon's is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.

Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that.",0

I agree with Will M. that it would be great at Norterra and lets face it, there are empty spots there just waiting for a great gym.   I love the attitude at this gym and the metro location as well.  There is always someone onsite caring for the equipment and keeping the place clean and tidy.  I dont remember that care when i was at LA Fitness.  The equipment is color coded to the muscle they work and that is awesome!  I like the staff and the people that go here and have made many friends.   They also have this new finger print system so you don't need a gym card with you to go, you just enter your phone number and scan your finger (very cool).  Sorry if you are a twin and like to cheat though....  Also be sure you check out Costco before you join to see if they still have the special of a 2 year membership for $299.00 (that's about $12/month)  It's a smoking deal and is good for all gym locations across the nation.",0
"Phenom. 
The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila. 
Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice. 
It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be. 
The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made. 
I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish. 
Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure. 
Service is friendly and quick. 
I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale. 
Good food. You won't be disappointed.",0
"A definite four stars, the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in Scottsdale Civic Center. now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit, veg and the nectar of the gods, Coffee, all packed into one nice bright orange place.  

Old Town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find.  can i say I hope to see this as a Scottsdale yelp ""hidden gem.""

As for my last meal I had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations, the fresh basil really added the extra taste.  

Service was ok, a typical cafe style, the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious, the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go.   

So many Little restaurants like this keeps me looking for the next one.  Don't forget for later in the night AZ 88 is just down a few steps.  

Happy breakfast,
Kevin
PS there seems to be some kind of yelp trend, does a hand full of yelps make a difference in a restaurant, does that have a yelp definition when this happens.",0
"A pleasant place in Kierland Center, but has gone down hill from earlier visit.  Good house wine by the carafe, we had the French Merlot.  Very inconsistent food quality.  I had the spinach and frisee salad.  The poached egg was overcooked, so no yolk to add the a very dry salad.  No enough bacon fat to wilt the salad properly.  An average quality lamb shank without any evidence of the olives and other seasonings promised.  My friends filet of beef was ordered medium rare and served med. well.  Rather dry.  They refused to subsitute for the brussels sprouts, then the waiter came back and said they could do it after all.  Desert souflles were ordered by two diners, both were dry and flavorless.  They need to pay more attention in the kitchen.  Overall, a very average experience at above average pricing.",0
"Came here and did drive-though to pick up a turkey sandwich and the ""man"" salad.   The salad was really good!!!!  On a hot summer day, the salad is a perfect choice for lunch!!!",0
"Bring a flashlight. It is so dark inside you can not read the menu. But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations. 

We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate. They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag.

The wine list is extensive and expensive.  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating . 

Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint .",0
overpriced for an average course,0
"These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.

I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.",0
"6 cities in 10 days.....no significant delays, great service and the food was even good. Get rid of the lowly 757's to Hawaii and give me the fancy LAX-JFK 777 for all 5 hour flights, plus redo the overhead compartments in the 767's and I'll give Delta 5 stars. 

Great job with the merger as the employees/customers seem much, much happier!",0
"Sheraton Desert Oasis is a great value in the late spring/early summer to get away for a few days and relax. 

It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.

But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. 

It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. 

You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. 

This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.",0
"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home. 
Every pizza place likes to say its ""New York Style"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water.",0
"I really enjoy this course but I am saving the 5 out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you don't have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.  Haven't eaten there but Ted's Hot Dogs is close enough that you'd be crazy not to go there after your round.",0
"Good, but the salad was not as good as remembered.  Still think its a great spot in scootsdale!",0
"Coworker and I met for lunch this afternoon.  Restaurant was understandably busy and there was a delay in the delivery of our food.

When my pear omelet with potatoes arrived, it brought mixed reactions. The omelet itself was served hot, and loaded with bacon and cheese.  The potatoes served alongside were STILL FROZEN in the middle.   We were unable to catch the attention of the hectic servers to get this corrected. When I brought my plate to the bartender, he poked the potatoes with his fingers, and then asked me if it would be OK if he kept the same omelet, but ""throw some fresh potatoes"" on the plate.  The server said that, if the kitchen had to remake the omelet, there could be a long delay. 

I could only respond with a shrug. He left and went to the kitchen with my plate. Several other people touched and poked the plate and potatoes before replacing them.  He then brought the plate back to me at the bar, and not my table. 

End result - good omelet, mediocre potatoes, below-poor service and follow-up.",0
"I've been to Barrio twice now.  Simply put, I do not believe that it is worth the prices that they charge. The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  

Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  

I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.

Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).

The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.

I don't really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless I'm craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster.  I'd go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner.",0
"Now THIS is ramen! I even ordered it for take out and could tell with my first slurp that it was everything I'd been looking for. Complex broth, yummy noodles, all the right toppings...the only thing I would have changed is the pork, which was tough and chewy and not melt-in-your mouth delicious. I'd definitely try again while dining in to see if the quality I'd the pork improved. The rest of the ramen was so tasty it didn't matter! 

Also, for take out the service was super quick and friendly. The prices are great, too! I got the ramen lunch special which came with a California roll that was incredibly tasty and fresh, and it came out to under ten bucks for a lot of food!",0
"Beware the latte. Otherwise this is a typical Circle K. Come to think of it, the latte is probably typical of Circle K as well.",0
"food is ok, but service is very slow!",0
"I adore all of Joe's restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means it's still better than most of the restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.) 
I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think I'll have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joe's establishments. 
I wasn't completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day.
That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!",0
"I've been meaning to try Humble Pie for a while, and as luck would have it this weekend I was in the right place at the right time and we decided to stop in. 

Rumors are true, everything is delicious. We shared the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was flavorful, light, and summery. Then we split the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage pizza. It was flavorful, spicy, and delicious. I will definitely be back to Humble Pie when I need a pizza fix.",0
"Lets just set the record straight here. Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.

When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. 

The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way ""bad"", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of ""I've had better"" when thinking about my experience.

If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but don't take me at my word on that just made up fact).

Happy Yelping Phoenix, now where's my hummus?",0
"Great Pizza! Great food! Great service! Still, this place isn't perfect....

BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Alright, most people seem to know this going in (we did too). However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you won't be seated until 11:30pm, that doesn't mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If you're not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown. At 10:00pm we were deemed worthy to stay on the list and wait another 45 minutes or so.

Service: the hostess knows she holds all the cards--sort of like the lady at the cash register for the Soup Nazi. However, a smile was all it took to get one back from her for me. Still, I can see how others might misconstrue her attitude as something less than cordial. Our server was great though! Very helpful and fun. He was as excited to serve us as we were to eat there. Good stuff!

The pizza is indeed great! But after waiting 4 hours, I was expecting the heavens to part and birds to sing and the ground to shake. Nope. Just made-from-scratch, meticulously-thought-out, high-quality pizza. A light and airy, smoky crust, a decent sauce and fresh mozzarella formed the basis of the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas that we tried. The quality and tastiness of the toppings were also apparent. We were impressed. This was absolutely great pizza--one of the best we've ever had. ...I just don't know if I'll hurry back to Pizzeria Bianco to wait that long again.",0
Very delicious and friendly! They do happy hour every day which is so great! The sushi is always very delicious and the same with their entrees. I love how close this is to my house. We visit this place quite frequently!,0
"Marriott's beds are always the most comfortable out of all the hotels I've stayed. I would not recommend Marriott Phoenix Airport for an extended (more than a week) stay, though. All in all, the hotel is nice, and the staff is probably the friendliest I have dealt with in a long time. 

There is no free WiFi, and you'd think that a chain like Marriott would provide it for free. There are no refrigerators or microwave ovens in the rooms, either.",0
"Popped into Sol Mexican Cocina before a movie one night for Happy Hour.  We were seated quickly, which was great because there was only 15 minutes left for happy hour and we wanted to get our order in before it ended.  Our waitress was SOOO... nice!  She had a great personality and was attentive and informative, pretty much everything you would want in a waitress.

We ordered everything off the happy hour menu, so I can't comment on the main menu, but the happy hour food was great!  The Hubs and I shared the pork tacos and chicken tacos - he loved the chicken and I loved the pork - go figure.  We shared guacamole, which was good, but needed a bit more seasoning.  By adding the salsa, which was served with it, it became quite good.  BTW, love the unique ""chips"" that are served here... some of our had a ton of seasoning and others had only a little - we liked the ones with just a little.  We also shared the empanadas (I think that's what they were), anyway they were really good.

Overall, we had a great happy hour experience here.  It thoroughly redeemed my not so enthusiastic impression from the Yelp event here (just about the food, not the event).  I can't say enough great things about our waitress - can't remember her name, but she was awesome.  I am sure we will be back soon to try out their main menu.",0
"Oh, YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service. Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!! Oh, and they talk to you so you can understand, not computer talk. Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!!",0
"I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.

We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!",0
Had the signature Black Chile entree.  It was fabulous!,0
"A definite favorite in the neighborhood.

The happy hour menu is always interesting and good. In several visits I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, and the beers on special are uniformly impressive.",0
A pain to get in and out of. I dread each trip I have to take to this place.,0
"Great quality. Their Pad Thai with chicken is the best I've ever had. Fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Their Yupha's Fried Rice is delicious with the pineapple compliments. Their Red Curry gets a 2 star rating for just being Red Curry (it's not as creamy, fresh, or flavorful as Thai Basil on University). It's a neighborhood gem and I'm lucky enough to live right around the corner from Yupha's Thai Kitchen!

Also, it's clean, bright, and has an inviting ambiance. It's perfect for a sit in casual dining experience, and even nice for takeout. 

Staff is friendly and attentive. 

Come here. Seriously.",0
"Great shopping. Even better people watching! Here you can shop stores ranging from H&M and Pac Sun, to Prada, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton. It's a pretty upscale mall, so most shoppers dress to impress, while other people recognize the fact that it is still JUST a mall, so they don't. That being said, you'll never feel out of place, no matter what you show up wearing. I love the valet area the most... it's littered with tricked out Bentleys, Lambos, Ferraris, and Aston Martins! I mean, I drive a REALLY nice car, and I would still be ashamed to valet it there!

My favorite store is probably Lush! I have a tendency to spend a lot of money in that store!! Sephora is a close second... I'm always on the lookout for my next favorite cologne!

Fashion Square also boasts some pretty good dining as well! Modern Steak, albeit very pricey serves up a damn good slab of steak. On my next visit I'd like to try the Kobe beef hot dog!! Z Tejas, Kona Grill, and the Yard House all offer great happy hour and reverse happy hour deals on food and beverages!

All in all, this mall is impeccably clean, very inviting, and fun to shop!",0
"The best gyro you will have in Arizona...
or maybe anywhere.

Love the grocery selection.
Everyone there is really nice.
And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.",0
"Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.",0
"Great white sangria and margaritas!!!  We went for dinner, but ended up ordering appetizers and a pitcher of white sangria. All I can say is the service was great but the drinks are amazing!!!  The tortilla chips  were fresh and homemade.  The ceviche was so tasteful!",0
Home sweet home love it ...only wish is more hot water for showers other than that it's a great place to live,0
"I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her.",0
"Good place to meet a group, watch a game or grab a quick bite. We found this place on St. Patrick's Day after a long, frustrating day of apartment searching. No wait, quick/good/friendly service, good food and lots of good beer. I like the segmented areas and because it is so big, even when there is a huge crowd, you never feel like you have lost your personal space. Have walked over many times since and will definitely continue to.",0
"I've stayed at an Aloft before.  They are pretty much all the same.  My king room was clean, modern, and well maintained.  I went in the winter, but had it been summer, I probably would have taken advantage of the pool and outdoor lounge area.  Even the gym looked appealing, and that's saying a lot.  The major downfall (and I say major because the whole point of a hotel is to sleep) is that the bed pillows are so incredibly uncomfortable.  It is almost impossible to fall asleep.  Someone please get some decent pillows in there!",0
"BEST CARNE ASADA (GRILLED SLICED STEAK), HACIENDA-STYLE HOSPITALITY. A MEXICAN FOOD EXPERIENCE IN THE THEME-PARK STYLE.

--colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail;
--dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above;
--this place and the adjacent ranch market are a ""must-do"" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here);

--Don't miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one ""portion"" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference;
--grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows);
--both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans;
--juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; ""asada"" goodness knows no bounds;
--guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THAT'S what I'm TALKing about !!!
--table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn;
--try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas.
--no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!)

--pork was a bit dry; is ""gamey"" possible in pork?
--server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go.

After so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more!

If you don't have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest you'll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room.

Don't miss the Ranch Market next door; you won't see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town. Take your camera.",0
"They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you don't have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!",0
Omg! So good! So fresh! Great burger joint. Ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with grilled onions. The steak was tender and perfectly pink. Husband ordered the Original with fries. The burger was juicy and a good size. The fries were perfectly seasoned and fresh. We split a drink. Total bill was a bit over $14. Not a bad dinner price. Place was empty when we got here at 9:00 on a Saturday night but quickly filled up. Great service and great food. We will make The Habit a habit!,0
"i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself.",0

Dateline 7 May 2009
Scottsdale, Arizona

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, ""That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.""

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, ""I really like the onion naan.""  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was ""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.""  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was ""Yummy.""

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; ""...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again.""",0
"Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend.",0
"Apparently I'm late to the party on this one, but my first visit to Sierra Bonita Grill was last weekend for brunch. I'm hesitant to add another good review of this great place because I didn't have to fight anyone for a table, and I would like to be able get one in the future.

Anyway... I'm a huge fan of brunch (and especially of Mexican/Latin American-type brunches), so I was thrilled to try this place. My friend ordered the Verde Vaqueros, which are their verison of biscuits and gravy. But the biscuits are no ordinary biscuits, they're Green chile beer biscuits (!) with smoked sausage gravy from Schreiners. The biscuits were delicious. I could eat them with anything... or really without anything else. My friend cleaned his plate. I got the stacked chicken enchiladas because I'm a sucker for anything with hatch chiles, and they did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful, and the crispy tortillas were a nice texture contrast to the rest of the dish.

Will definitely be back, and would definitely recommend that people check this place out for brunch... just don't take my table.",0
"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of ""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! 

 Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.",0
"After SMOCA opening night, I just wanted to relax with some friends and not go get wasted or have to wait a long time to get a seat at a trendy bar on a Friday night. Oh yeah, and get something to eat. I had remembered some generally good reviews of Drift, had noticed it when going to shows at Martini Ranch, and really wanted something with coconut (?).

After a terrifying short-cut with a walking GPS that I was sure was leading us to our death (or at least led us to dog-shit on the sidewalk at one point), we ended up here with a nice enough door guy. Inside I was really impressed. It was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, more sophisticated and while it was Tiki-themed, I thought it was very tongue in cheek COOL interpretation of tiki (very hard to pull off). 

We asked for a booth and got one near the door (which lead to superior people watching later). Our booth was creamy, spacious, left us with no ass swamp, (although the acoustics were a little bad-I had trouble hearing someone two people away) and showed us more intimate tables in very Ikea-esqe and mod black leather. This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there.

Our waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night. 

Looking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting. On the way to the bathrooms, a small open lounge was dominated by one party having a lot of fun. The bathroom sink blew my mind and I still don't know what sets it off...although my theory is some dude needs to flush the toilet for water to come down and vice versa. I started freaking out in my drunky state, saying ""I have soapy hands goddamit! And I'm smart! How does this shit turn on!"" wiping my hands on the sink with tiny amounts of water.

Overall, a very chill scene with a bizarre assortment of people (bro dogs, homely couples, musicians, barbies, and just regular folks) perfect for a second or third date for a casually romantic drink or two.",0
"Been here several times for lunch and had the pizza. Today my friend & I decided to try the sandwiches. Very disappointing! I had the Roast Beef & my friend had the Turkey. Both were lackluster and smothered with slimy roasted red peppers. If you go to Humble Pie, go for the pizza (and the Happy Hour!)",0
"Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.",0
I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.,0
"A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place.

Pros:

Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food

Good specials to keep things mixed up

Great company and service

Cons:

Guy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes

Pricey for some dishes

Interesting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.)

the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass

Overall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean.",0
"Was super annoyed by this Sephora. The first three times I was asked if I was ""doing ok?"" was not bothersome. By the tenth time I was asked, I really felt like the employees were going to frisk me. I had a baby with me! I really hope I don't have to do any holiday shopping here. I'd rather go somewhere else.",0
Went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show. It was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to Pink Floyd music. After the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon. First friday of every month!,0
"I've gotta say, Nordy's (as my aunt refers to Nordstom since it's her favorite department store ever) is always a safe bet if you're looking for quality selection, customer service, and a very pleasant shopping experience.  Whether you're looking for shoes, lingerie, cosmetics, apparel, etc... you'll likely find it at Nordy's.

I'll have to take Samantha O's and Julia T's advice and remember to go to Nordstom's next time I need a new bra.

In the meantime, I've gotten lucky with shoes, all kinds of clothes, accessories, and perfume.  This weekend is a big sale.  I ran in earlier to return something and walked out with a new pair of shoes.  Oops.  Take that as a warning, Nordstrom can be dangerous for shop-a-holics.

The only times I have not gotten lucky at Nordstrom are when I've been on a mission for something specific - such as Converse Sneakers in Jared's size 7 or a certain shirt or bathing suit in my size.  But I'll overlook these times and return again and again... Keep up the good customer service and selection, Nordy's - and I'll be a customer for life.",0
"I really liked the experience I had at Marcellino's on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!! 

But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.

Then, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.",0
"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this ""fast"" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!",0
"This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good. 

I love this place, and have been a die-hard fan for over 4 years now.",0
"Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same.",0
"Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?",0
"If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare. 

Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. 

Experiences with the order could be as follows: 
Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. 
Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. 
Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. 
Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. 

Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.",0
"great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular",0
"Here's the 1. 2. 3...

1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job.
2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty.
3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno! 

We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!

4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!",0
"I love that this place has top seafood plates and choices. The services is hit and miss but once i went in with three friends and we sat at the sushi bar and they saw we weren't getting service they grabbed our order right away. Happy hour is good and drinks aren't expensive anyhow so drinkers celebrate! Cherry roll (i do it without sauce), octopus, anything with their eels, i love the quality of salmon as well. The best part is that FOOD IS SERVED TILL 2AM!!",0
"This is my favorite haunt. Whether it be St. Patricks Day, before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink. Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great. The food is the good, whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner. 

This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me.",0
"3+ meals for $10.75? GREAT DEAL! Ask for your meal to go, so you don't have to pay 50 cents for take out box :)

How do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.

I recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!

Advice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.

Ask the nice Mongolian BBQ chefs to add pineapples and cilantro, and then when they finish cooking up your food, add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin!",0
"Not bad. Not super amazing. My cafe rumba burrito was okay, line was moving a little slow but the employees were nice.",0
"I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?",0
I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.,0
"I really don't consider myself a Neiman's type of girl...
As a matter of fact, I don't really feel comfortable in Neiman's - it's extremely 'fancy' and high end for me.  But, I've gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neiman's in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing.

Anyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neiman's from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neiman's location on Sunday.  The housewares / registry department is extremely small... and although the woman working was sweet, she botched the spelling of Jared's name in the process.  Needless to say, i was not so impressed.

Fancy sums this department store up in my eyes - I'm much more of a Nordstrom's or Macy's or Bloomingdales type of girl!",0
Delish & authentic! The serving was generous (meat combo fed 2). The injera was good (not too thick/doughy). Spicy and yummy. I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony.,0
"Well.. i love the space. It feels like a fresher, newer LUX.  EVerythings ""newer""..that's the only real difference (oh..and it;s 3 blocks over). Same varied array of mid-century modern tables and chairs.  Original artwork spread thru-out.   I've heard it the same original owners of LUX so it makes sense.    Even the espresso tastes like LUX.. which i don;t care for really.. tastes burnt.  I love my espresso... but not here nor there.

i love the space, its convenient, evreyone was friendly but (BIG BUT).. they close at 7pm Here's why i find it a problem... .Near a big High Rise, off the light rail (central and c-back).. so I would assume the majority of the crowd would prefer showing up, having a copa de cafe', enjoy some wi-fi surfing, mingle with friends.. but... how can I if i get off work at 5... i;m home by 5:30... freshen up at home.. it';s now 6.... i walk to  Lola... its now 6:15... I order my coffee... it;s ready.. i sit down.. it;s 6:30, I now have 30 minutes to enjoy my espresso read the paper or check my email.  

but hey,,, that;s just me.  

why do I give it 4 stars u may ask... again.. i love the space, the people, the art.. the furniture.. and most importantly I love small local business.


PLEASE STAY OPEN LATER! (and reconsider your espresso bean)",0
Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.,0
"Ordered the pork ramen and a rainbow roll. Both were great, sushi was like every other good sushi place and pork ramen was tasty and spicey. Good service from waiter but the hostesses weren't able to keep up with everyone and forgot we were there and had us wait awhile. Other than that, experience was good and would come back.",0
"The sign also bills itself as 'Santa Fe style' food. Having lived many years in New Mexico, with a family - generations of which are from New Mexico - the cuisine was decidely not New Mexican. It was standard Sonoran.

With that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.  We would probably come back.

I had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here. If you are looking for New Mexican style-cuisine, you won't find it either. 

However, if you are looking for a decent, enjoyable meal at a local family-owned establishment, this is a good choice.",0
"My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Don't do it, you will regret it!",0
"My wife and I visited LGO a while back and we were both impressed and enjoyed our meal. The WINGS were by far the best I have ever tasted. Our pizza was great, we had the pepperoni and ricotta. It does get kinda crowded and chaotic on weekend nights. The grocery store in pretty cool but didn't buy anything. Like a previous review, it did feel like a upscale Cracker Barrel. All around a great place to eat. Also, Take a camera so you can take pictures of all the lame hipster clowns that try to make it all about them. They are the only downside to LGO.",0
"They're really slipping now.  With dinner, you get cole slaw - you can ""upgrade"" to soup or salad for 2.50 more.  Really?  I've never heard of cole slaw being a pre-meal before.  I got the French Onion Soup, its actually better at Mimi's.  They put way too much cheese, the bread is pathetic and there's hardly any onions in it.

The prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter.  Never heard of that before either.  Luckily I had some sour cream with my baked potato and I asked for some raw horseradish so I can concoct my own.  Wasn't the best, but way better than the butter!  

The barbeque chicken was ok.  I've had better at diners.  They didn't really season the bird, just threw some barbeque sauce on it.  At least it wasn't terribly dry...

I don't think I'm coming back to this one.  Nooooo..",0
"This will be a simple post...I love indian food, and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az. The Chicken makhani is so buttery, so savory...the Chicken tikka masala, the best I ever had. Service is always good, the food comes out fast. It's not super cheap, since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart, but it is worth it. If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers. When in rome!",0
"We love this restaurant. It's a family-owned place and you always feel welcome. The food is excellent, especially compared to On the Border, etc.

Order the guacamole.

A tad pricey but it's North Scottsdale, so what do we expect?",0
"If you have dietary restrictions or are insanely health-conscious (like me), YOU MUST TRY NOURISH.

This is an amazing culinary experience for two reasons. 

First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.

The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.

p.s.  Thanks for the tour.",0
"The BEST of the BEST!

I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs.

Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed.",0
"I was hoping for a more adult friendly place. I haven't been here in years, it used to be a gay-friendly hotspot. Now it seems to caters more to families and children. I've heard the restaurant is good, but I haven't visited yet.",0
"I used to live off this place. They cut their meats and cheeses fresh like a real deli, so already it kicks the shit out of Subway, Quiznos, and every other fast food deli chain that offers up pre-packaged meats. Their bread and cookies are fresh as well. For some reason, this location has better tasting food than any other Port-o-Subs I've been to. Don't know why.

There's always a long line at lunch, but it moves fast. There's some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that... 

Most of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well. Once I noticed some fruit flies buzzing around by the soda machine and was told they sometimes come with the fresh fruit they get for the smoothies (which are fantastic). Outside of that, I can't complain about this sub shop and I eat here all the time... it's almost just about as good as a non-chain place.",0
"Like anyone else with good taste, I think this place was better when it was called ""The Library"". IDK when their specials are, but the first jager bomb was $2 on a Tuesday night, and I'll love them forever just on that alone. There's plenty of space to sit throughout the bar, a restroom attendant, and usually a DJ.

It reminds me of sports bars you find everywhere in Glendale, just with a younger crowd.",0
"I like these sort of ""mom & pop"" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but we've tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!",0
"One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!",0
"After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.  

I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).

Highlights:
Tasty drink menu
Fabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish style
Great part of town
Sexy servers...dang

Impress someone: Take them to FEZ!",0
"Tried this for the first time today.  While my hubbies french toast was wonderful and the kiddos enjoyed their meal, my biscuits and gravy tasted much like bacon grease and flour.  Sending it back and trying something else is what I would have liked to do, but the server never returned to check on us until my family was finished with their meal.  The owner did apologize and asked us to give them a try again.  Maybe I will, if the staff gets some training.  Everyone seemed completely overwhelmed.  It's too bad~as I love going out for breakfast.",0
"People used to rave about this place - I never got it...and I find it interesting that several other folks said the SAME thing in their reviews.  The parking lot would be full if you didn't get here before 7 PM, the service was always terrible and the crowd was overwhelmingly hipster morons.  Yeah, sure - that's better than the popped collar frat boy meat heads on Mill Ave but not who I want to spend my time with.

This place is for folks with too much to prove.

I'm pretty sure I only went once - maybe twice...I won't be back.",0
"AZ88, the cousin of Hanny's, brings more glitz and better food selections than is Downtown relative.  My friend had a killer salad with buffalo chicken and I had a tremendously delicious burger with avocado, jalapenos, and salsa.  They were able to accommodate my desire to skip the fruit and veggie sides and go all waffle fries for me.  When I asked for dipping sauces beside ketchup, I got three choices.  I would only complain that their water glasses are far too small, especially for some of their spicier dishes.  I think the expectation is that you have cocktail to help you wash away some of the heat.  Speaking of their cocktails, the martinis, which I have had on a different occasion, are quite good.  This place definitely provides for an evening out and makes you forget that you live in Phoenix.",0
"Yes, it is small, yes, it takes time to get your order, but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!! Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.  She takes your order, runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too. I wouldn't say that this is a one person resturant, because she has help in the kitchen.  
Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one. The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.",0
"If you like beer, you'll love Papago.   They have a huge beer selection and the prices are very good.  When ever I'm in Scottsdale, I make it a point to visit them.",0
Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back,0
"La Grande Orange is great......at certain times! I used to work by there and the curbside pick-up is fantastic. Other than that? I find myself hesitating to go there now because of the atrocious parking situation. This place is an absolute zoo on the weekends and when I can't find a parking spot by the restaurant, I find myself parking in the surrounding neighborhood worrying that my car may be towed when I come out! 

Needless to say, their homemade English Muffins are amazing. I really could just survive on those happily for the rest of my life. The grape preserves on the side are fantastic as well...and I don't even like grape preserves! That, paired with their coffee, makes for one of the best breakfasts in the Valley. And, if you're splurging? Go for the salted chocolate chip cookie if they have it. It makes me happy just thinking about it. :-)

This place is great if you have a weekday morning available to come here..or an hour or two on the weekend. The little shopping area is great to browse around - when you can figure out a way through all the people in line! Don't get me wrong..the food is fantastic. I just like a little more relaxation on my weekend than fighting through the hordes just to get that amazing english muffin. It's worth it, but then I just feel tired.....annoyed. And that's really not how I want to start my weekend off. 

If you can....call in the order for Curbside Pick Up. That way, you can enjoy LGO without the frustration of finding the mythical parking spot, standing in a long line (albeit trendy) and searching for a table with everybody else so you don't have to eat the wonderfulness standing up.",0
"Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)",0
Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.,0
"Yup, I'm reviewing a gas station. I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.

I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.

With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what? 

Bonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street, this is the Hot Chick Gas Station.",0
"As a pretty devoted Fry's shopper, I have to say this is one of my least favorite locations. Unfortunately, it's the closest one to me, so I end up there often. It's almost always crowded, the layout is less than intuitive, and I've gotten questionable produce on more than one occasion. The employees are friendly enough, but it's just no comparison to other locations.

By the looks of it outside, it seems like it would be pretty large, but once you get inside it's cramped and the selections seem limited. 

I suppose this is mostly things they can't change, but it's enough to make me drive a few miles out of my way to avoid it if I have the time.",0
"The view from the top is quite amazing! I took my fiancee up here for a sunrise as part of her proposal, and she loved it!! You really can see the whole valley. As you're driving around Phoenix and have an unobstructed view to the south, you should be able to see all of the radio antennas at the top. You'd be surprised how high you are when you finally up get there. The rangers up there are friendly too. Just as some of the other reviews state though, do WATCH OUT for random bike riders, runners, and various pedestrians on your way up and in. The roads are a little narrow and there is not much room for error.",0
"A perfectly good place for a chill Friday night dinner. I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! 

The chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. 

The service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. 

We just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.",0
"Not impressed. Beer was cold, but bar keep was disinterested in assisting us, atmosphere was drab, place was small, and the to go order was TERRIBLE! There was no BBQ the day we were there and I just wasn't feeling the place. 

My hubby and I have been missing this place since it closed its original restaurant in Cave Creek. We heard it moved to Phoenix and we found it and went there this past week. Unfortunately, it was nothing like the old, hopping, smell good, smokey, fun filled environment of the original SF. 

I can see that they have a lot of regulars and the barkeep knew everyone that walked through the door, which to me,  was very cool, but it just wasn't gelling for me this night I suppose. 

We ordered the deep Fried green chili's and there was soooo much batter  on them, I had to really concentrate hard to find the chili. I ended up peeling all of the batter off of the chili's just to get a small bite. icky. 

I would give this another chance just because I hate writing a bad review. So, after the holidays, may check it out on a Friday night and see where it stands then, Also, I will hope that when I arrive next time, the smoker out back is kicking and there is some REAL BBQ to be had.",0
"Here last night with friends. We had to wait a little longer to be seated than I would have liked but we were a party of five so I understand. Once we were seated service was quick and pleasant. We shared a couple of the flatbreads to start, so by the time we ordered entrees I was already pretty full and went with a salad, the strawberry balsamic, which was delicious and just made me feel all ready for summer. We were there quite a while talking and enjoying our meal, and the staff never made us feel hurried although it was a pretty busy night. We tipped well enough that I don't feel bad about taking up space for that long, that's something I always make sure to do in that situation.",0
"Don't be confused by the Yelp definition, ""Yay, I'm a fan"",  Lowes gets 4 stars because they have great employees that get me out of there fast!  I'm not one that would typically be classified as ""Handy"", so the fact that I can go into Lowe's, and get someone to give me DIY instructions in about 5 minutes, makes me happy.  I've been to several Lowe's/Home Depot's in the past, but I feel compelled to review this location, because after 10+ trips (mostly on the weekends), I have never had to wait for assistance or behind more than one customer in line.  Also, they get bonus points for not only allowing my pups in the building, but complementing them on their cuteness =).",0
Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.,0
"Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real, and they're spectacular. 

Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. 

Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.

Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was ""Squaw"" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term ""Squaw"", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as ""Negress"" or ""Jewess"". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.

And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.

NOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny.",0
"I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friend's first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. I'm glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back.",0
"I love you, Marquee Theatre. 

Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed. 
I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee. The bartenders are really friendly, the bouncers do a great job, and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal. Not to mention, the sound guys do an awesome job. 

I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there. 

The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks. 

All in all, I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time.",0
"Great drinks!!!

Good atmosphere

Fantastic food (the bbq chicken pizza is a must)

Nice people to conversate with

What is not to like?

Oh yes, the creepy guy that kept staring at me. Oh well, he will not be there next time I go...I hope :)",0
"This location has been so many different restaurants in the past few years and now there is finally a good one! It's basically a fancied-up paradise bakery with better food, bread, and condiments. Oh and better prices too. I had a small Chipotle Chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink, for only $10.58. The soup was great! And they let me sample several kinds before making my decision. I also loved that they had at least a dozen different kinds of hot sauce bottles on the wall that customers are free to use as they please. I tried three because I like to bring the heat and because they were available.  

My only complaint was that the dirty dish bin was overflowing even though the place was super slow. Can't someone handle that? Its gross to have to move other people's dirty dishes around in order to fit yours in there. Ts seems like an easy thing to fix- someone pick up dirty dishes every couple of hours or something.",0
"I've only been here once, and for good reason. To put it nicely, the service was seriously lacking. I walked in and nothing. They didn't ask if I needed help looking for something, greet me, or even acknowledge me until I was about to pay. I guess the magazine the cashier was reading was VERY important. I've been to several comic book stores and I don't need someone to hold my hand, I would just like common courtesy. On the positive it was a organized place and the selection was pretty good.",0
"Tucked in a quite plaza In Chandler AZ, is an un-assuming, little Thai restaurant with BIG flavor. Despite the lack-luster curb appeal from the outside, the inside is quaint and clean. 
Get things started with some spring rolls. The sauce isn't mind blowing, but those 6 dainty morsels of fried goodness have got some real flavors goin on. (especially when dipped in your curry)
I recommend their signature dish, ""Thai Basil,"" for those who haven't been here before. 
I prefer an extra spicy, KANG-DANG (red curry): Your choice of meat, simmered in coconut milk with bamboo shoots, bell pepper, broccoli, carrots, green beans and Thai basil, Served with jasmine rice.  

I will say, some menu items are hit and miss. So don't judge this place based on ONE dish you don't like. (You can find something you aren't going to like on every menu across the country). 
Friendly service, fresh ingredients, and an authentic ""je ne sais quoi,"" earn Thai Basil 4 stars. ""I'm a fan."" 
Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.  - Cheers",0
"We arrived at US Egg on St. Patrick's Day at 10:00 am before the A's vs. Giants Spring Training game and only had a wait of 15 minutes. Not bad to start! Promptly seated we were brought a pitcher of water and ordered our breakfast. The Denver Scramble is delicious! My husband ordered the Hash & eggs - reasonably priced, quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right!",0
"Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!

Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!",0
"We were staying at a local hotel and used online ordering to feed our crew.  The ordering went smoothly and the pleasant surprise was the food arrived early and warm.  We ordered two of their usual pizzas and one of our custom orders.  Could have had a few more toppings on one of them, but overall nice value and timely service with warm food.  We looked for the specials on-line and save a few dollars.  Worth the time to do so.  Would order again.",0
"My family and I love this place. Yummy food, great service, kid friendly, rarely a wait, great prices, nice beer selection, food always comes out hot, and people around you are having a good time. The boneless chicken with raspberry barbecue sauce is so so yummy!",0
"FINALMENTE!!!

Andiamo....

FOOD
--------
Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.

Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". 

And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.

The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. 

And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.

As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. 

SERVICE
-------------
Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. 

And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. 

SETTING
-------------
I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. 

The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. 

I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. 

EXTRA CRIB NOTES
-----------------------------
* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.
* It's great
* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.
* it's great
* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). 
* it's great
* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.
* it's great
* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?
* did I tell you it's great?

ALL IN ALL
---------------
An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. 

I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.

And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...",0
"This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.  This location is better than the others I have been to - quieter, friendlier staff.  The theaters are clean and usually not packed either.

I love the t-shirt and cup program - and buying tickets at Costco.  I went to AMC last month, and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either.",0
"If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend. 

Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training...... 

Yep, I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.) 

What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food. 

Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty. 

Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, ""Hey, that sounds good!!"", and quickly pulled into the parking lot? 

If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories. 

Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states. 

Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there. 

Give it a chance....see if you like it.",0
"Let's be honest, when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes you'll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds.  If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.

Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.

I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.

I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.  Just check this place out, you'll be happy you did.",0
"My husband surprised me with a stay-cation at the Westin Resort for the weekend and we ate here on our first night!

Let me just say, I LOVE MUDDLED DRINKS, I am not a fan of cosmos or martini's or anything that just tastes like strong alcohol - BLAH! For me stronger isn't better, flavor and uniqueness is better! This place has by far the best muddled drinks I have ever had! If you just want to go for drinks they have this cute little drink bar right before you enter the restaurant - separate from the main dining which I thought was nice. The decor is romantic latin! I love it! 

We started our dinner first by receiving these potato rolls. OMG where have these been my entire life!!!!???!! They are just fall apart in your mouth good! We both ordered mambo mango drinks - STELLAR! We then got the tres ceviches (lobster escabeche / mixto clasico / ruby red tuna) the lobster was the best! But all very good. However the crab empanada was my favorite! YUM!

My husband got the jidori chicken and myself the adobo pork. Both were good but not GREAT. Too much seasoning on my pork. To me this place is a MUST go to for drinks and small bites. I would have given this place five stars but the entrees just didn't do it for us. However, it was not horrible - just okay. The rest of our experience with dinner - service, restaurant ambiance, overall feel and all of our food and drinks before the entrees was AMAZING! So we will be back just for a more small bites and drink night!",0
"This is a great dog park. There are two sides, a big dog side and a little dog side. There is a little bit of seating but you can bring a chair if you want. There is water for the dogs and pooper scoopers as well. Everyone that visits for the most part is pretty nice except for the occasional crazy lady who tries to discipline other people's dogs. 

The only thing that would make this dog park better would be if it had lights so you could come at night and if it had more shady areas for the hot summers!",0
"This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.",0
"OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!

Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!

I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! 

There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.

Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.

And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.

As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!",0
"From the outside the place looked alot busier however, Not a bad place to go for lunch on Friday afternoon. Especially when it's close to 1pm as the place was pretty empty. My coworker order brisket tacos and they came out stuffed with tons of brisket. She said they they were very good and I will take her word for it as they looked pretty tasty. Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum. 

So why only three stars? Well It's actually 3.5 stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off. Like I said the place was empty and yet our server either forgot about us at times or was busy doing something else in the back. Nicole, our server was sweet enough but still.... hmmm. Oh well no biggie. It was empty and we did get in and out in under an hour but not 5 star worthy. Will I be back again? Probably as the food was pretty good. Heck the chips and salsa alone are worth giving it another shot.",0
"Enjoyed sitting outside and the barra viejo shrimp dish.  I didn't find anything ""to die for"" but it's good.  More importantly it was a nice evening and I enjoyed the experience very much.  My waiter was very laid back and friendly.  I didn't feel rushed and was able to have a relaxed dinner.  Case in point- I'm usually a one-drink girl, but I had 2 that day.",0
"I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.  

The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday ""brown bag"" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.

"I am not a beer drinker, so this is not rating the beer, but the food and atmosphere.

1) Atmosphere: sweet - great patio and nice bar scene inside

2) Food - pretty good for bar food

3) Hit it up if you are in Tempe, its just one of those places you need to go",0
"I'm President of the Local scooter club so I know and deal with most of the dealers Valley Wide. Tylor the GM and team run a good shop. Very friendly. Don't get me wrong, they are there to make money but they are not push. You are free to hang out and ask lots of questions. Good assortment of accessories and they can pretty much get anything.

They know bikes and parts inside an out. Service on my Piaggion BV500 has been fast and fantastic. I did not say cheap, but fair.  Actually they had a Buy 1 tire get the 2nd for 1cent event this week. In the past they had a 1/2 price on all their helmets. Got a Scorpion $220 helmet for about $110. Just ask what and when they are having specials.

I don't buy the review below about bait and switch, pretty serious accusation. However, GoAZ and Gina over there are good people as well.",0
"I've been here a million times and usually have lunch at the bar.  This is the classic french brasserie style restaurant.  With a nod to Balthazar restaurant in NY's Soho this is a fun place.

This visit I sat at the bar and had the curry chicken sandwich on toasted sourdough.  I think that toasting the bread on any sandwich makes it better.  The sweet curry flavor make this sandwich a winner.

Sean may be the best bartender in Scottsdale.  He is always friendly and very efficient.

Definitely stop in here the next time you're at Kierland Commons.",0
"Finally! A non-corporate place in Chandler that doesn't try too hard, yet knows how to please with high-end ingredients: local and organic when possible!

I ordered the Chef's Burger from their lunch menu. Grass-fed, ground in-house 8 oz burger with arugula, Gruyère, and onion rings.  I personally would have liked the arugula melted under the Gruyère or tossed with the Russian dressing.  It was too ordinary undressed on the top bun. But, it IS the Chef's Burger and if that's how he likes it, then that's the way it should be enjoyed. Oh, and the onion rings are awesome.  

The service was genuine and friendly. The food came out reasonably fast and HOT!

It would have been nice if you could hear the music...it was just too quite.

I will definitely come back and try other menu options and I highly recommend BLD!!",0
"For quick fast food.. this is my choice.. I usually call ahead and get take out.. Dont expect super friendly.. but its just take out.. not clear table service.. even if you stay.. I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy.. NOW my friends that usually nosh with me.. hate the foods they get.. they say it every time I suggest this place.. who knows? Since I  havent really tried anything from my norm salad.. I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3..",0
"Recently ""discovered"" Rosati's in Ahh-wuh-too-key.  A friend (a former New Yorker no less) ordered us some thin crust, and I was surprised to find good ol' squares instead of slices.  I was even more surprised to find that it's the best Chicago style thin crust I've had in my 6+ years in the valley.  How have I not run across this place sooner?

I wish they had a ""junk"" or ""garbage"" pizza special, but the Classic Sausage will do.  Nice spicy hunks of sausage in almost every bite

Avoid the wings though!  Horrible.  Wings should be deep fried or grilled . . . maybe I got a bad batch, but I think they actually BOILED them?  Is that possible?  Irregardless, they were terrible. 

It's a huge kitchen with a small counter area for takeout, so don't plan on eating there.  It's in the strip mall with CK's . . . I wonder if CK's would let us bring in Rosati's pizza while we drink and watch the games . . . ?  Wings aside, it's my new Go To for pizza",0
Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Can't wait til I can walk here!,0
"I recall my first visit to Carolina's...

The time? About 1 PM.

As my GPS says ""You have arrived at your destination,"" I frantically look. I see nothing that looks like a hole in the wall restaurant!

Well, I review the exact address, and note that the address (1202 Mohave Street) matches the ""ghetto"" building with all the nice cars parked afront.

""Well, that must be it!""

I park. Then I walk up to the door. The entrance reminded me of a homeless shelter or food bank.

As I entered, the restaurant was filled with people.

Since then, I have repeated visits to Carolina's with a few favorites...

- Chips and Salsa
- Shredded Beef Taco (Crispy)
- Cheese Quesadillas
- Cheese Enchiladas

The food is low-priced. For example, tacos are about $2 each. Burritos are about $4 each.

Additional Notes:

- Closes relatively early in the evening.
- Serves breakfast.",0
"The manager at this location is a pretentious jerk, he is condescending and immature.  I will never return to this place or recommend it.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is sophisticated but the crowd is lame and the management is even worse. Spend your evening and your money elsewhere.",0
"My friend and I decided to try this place for happy hour around lunchtime since it's such a short walk from ASU.  I ordered a glass of the crossing, which was tangy, and a little on the dry side with a fruity aroma.  Going off of a college student's budget, we shared a plate of the bruschetta which was a bit pricey for 4 slices of baguette with toppings, but delicious nonetheless. Pulled pork and salmon were my two favorite! The atmosphere is great and it's always lively and full of people- plus it's a great location.",0
"Big fan of their SW Chicken Caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup. My favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini, the turkey cranberry, and the teriyakki chicken wrap. I love both wildflower and Paradise but Paradise Bakery has the best cookies. And although I do not get it very often because its a killer in calories, the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for!",0
"Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like. For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great! We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing. I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust. Also, this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant.",0
"Scrambled eggs, toast and hashbrowns.  Simple, basic and just what you want for an early morning breakfast.  It's kind of like having breakfast in someone's kitchen.  I'd recommend starting with (and sharing) one of their cinnamon rolls.  They're big and covered with frosting!  Good stuff!",0
"Come with an appetite!

I went for a work event which was real nice. We had the private dining room and the whole 9 yards.

All I can say is if you're not a fan of red meat or have a cholesterol problem don't bother. The ambiance is not as format as I assumed it to be due to the location and hype. Although, the meat and presentation is great. Anything you want sent right to your table and cooked however you would like. Just don't leave your card on the green for too long otherwise you will have more meat than you can handle.

On the other hand, the specialty drinks are good. I don't recall the name of it but they served a traditional Brazilian drink that was wonderful. Not as strong for my liking but good. The salad bar was great too. Everything was fresh and there sure was a lot to choose from. Probably the best I have seen in a while.",0
"Everyone here is very helpful and friendly.  No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet.  The vet calls me himself to discuss my cat's test results.  They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on.  I feel that my family gets good care from this vet.  We ended up moving about 15 minutes away, but still make the trip to see this vet.",0
"Q. How do you fix a broken pizza?
A. With tomato paste!

Ok, that sucked.

Spin-at-O's pizza is actually how it's pronounced as the owner learned to make pizza in Baltimore MD home of the Orioles or O's for short. Ok, I just made ALL that stuff up but it would have been cool. Right?

Spinato""s pizza and calzones are amazing. Very heavy and sauce rich. If you're on a diet STAY AWAY. If you're not calorie counting-COME HERE. Their thin pizza is very thin and very good! We got the baked spaghetti w/meatballs calzone and it was what you'd expect but wow was it great. 

Only downside after eating here: FOOD COMA ZZZZZzzzzzzZzzzzz :)",0
"No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out ""In and Out Man I love that place"" I think that says it all.",0
"Had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it. However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). 

I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.

The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. 

So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. 

The waiter:

* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.
* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.
* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...""oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano."" Bonus points for knowing that.

Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. 

All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. 

And there you have it.",0
"a bit too sweet (sweeter than Yogurtland and Red Mango), but liked the skinny mango and blueberry flavors, excellent spread of toppings (incl. green tea mochi) and great quality fruit. perfect stop-in on Mill.",0
Very VERY average. Actually disappointed in the braciole. Kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different.,0
"Video Paradise is great.  For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account, or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com, Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.

The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  ""You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!""  I mean, come on.  No one else has it.  

This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.

The décor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection.",0
"Finally tried Sucker Punch Sally's today and I think it has promise.  They are still on the small opening menu so the lunch choices were limited but I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and must say I was impressed.  Obviously made in house and not frozen, nice sized portion and very tasty, almost like a German schnitzel.  The fries were so-so, I don't care much for fresh cut fries as they are usually limp like these were.  Will definitely give them another try for breakfast and when they get the full menu going in a few weeks.  Nice vibe and the waitress was very friendly.  If you live in the area and have been thinking about it, give them a try.",0
"This place could be great, and I've always wanted to like it more than I actually do.  Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.

I have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short: 

1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show ""Friends;"" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?

2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, ""yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey.""  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.

3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.

Honestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.",0
Really nice jumping point for a good night in Phoenix. Crab Cake Sandwich was great!,0
"We visited for the annual Local First Fall Festival. There was no parking available, so we had to go across the street. There were also too many people, so crowding and navigation were problematic. There were a good number of tents offering free samples. It was great to try food from several local places, since we got to discover new places to visit later. Unfortunately, none were selling food, so we couldn't also get lunch on the spot and had to go elsewhere for a full meal. I like this event as a way to try food samples and explore potential places to visit in the future.",0
"Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday. So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.

However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.

Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? 

Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.

[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.' Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]",0
"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out.",0
"I am so not a fan of the dentist.  But Dr. Ito and his staff changed that.  Professional, yet relaxed attitudes.  From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.

While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's ""Smile"" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!  

I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?

I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.

I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.  You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office.",0
The best tai in downtown for the price! Masiman is the most tasty dish here!,0
"I have never had a bad meal from here. I can't say the service is quite up to par considering the menu, interior and pricing, but sometimes the food is all you need to be won over. This restaurant is within walking distance from my work and when I have gone for lunch, I have never had to wait. The host is professional and poised. Unfortunately, the hostesses are not as much. But again, you can quickly look past that. The menu has already changed at least a couple of times which makes the dining even more fulfilling because you can keep trying new things! The food is definitely not average or casual cafe style, yet you can find things on the menu such as homemade chips, baked macaroni and cheese and a buffalo sloppy joe. The bar is beautiful and they have live jazz on Saturday nights.Great for a business lunch, a romantic dinner or tasteful happy hour.",0
"Very pleasant hip restaurant. Try as many Bruchetta options as you can; each order comes with 4 pieces (potentially 4 different toppings), and all the ones I got were delicious: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil.",0
"Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.  
The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80's.  
My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.   
My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!",0
"Man, I love Southwest.  Best airline ever.  After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks.  It's nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay.  Cheers to that!",0
"Really mixed feelings here. Met a friend here on a Thursday about 6:45. Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasn't totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.

The beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe I'm just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the women's so can't address that, sorry ladies)

I'll try it again though. Food was OK, not great. Probably won't be a regular hangout since it's not close by to where I live and it didn't seem worth going out of the way for considering how many other beer bars/breweries there are around the city with better atmosphere.",0
"Sweet Potato Tater Tots..................why are you still reading?  what more needs to be said?  Yum Yum getcha some!

The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground, its NOT - keep your kids at the table or at home.",0
"I went to Susie's for lunch the other day. I got it to go, as I was alone and don't like to eat at restaurants by myself. There was only a few people inside and the food seemed to come pretty fast if you eat in. 

I probably waited about 20 mins for my to go food. I thought the restaurant was in need of a remodel. But they don't seem like they have the greatest hours, as they close at 5pm. So it is a lunch place, not a dinner place.

I got my food and took it home. I live not even a mile from this place. I ordered Sopes. They had shredded beef, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and salsa. I thought they were very comparable to the ones I have had before, which were homemade. 

I would like to go back for lunch, but as I'm not home much for lunch it might be difficult! Definitely worth a second chance!",0
"We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldi's, regardless of the location.

The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--I'm sure we'll be back to see.",0
"I've been to corporate events, concerts and Spring Training games here, and I've been consistently surprised at how well they do what they do.  

First the field.  At Spring training games you are so close you feel like you're watching a little league game.  The grass is go green it almost looks fake (it's not).  And the backdrop of office and apartment buildings is decidedly suburban.  I finally get the big draw.  

Next - the vendors. Taco in a bag (must experience to believe).  Strawberries and banana dipped in chocolate on a stick.  Great pizza.  Amazing choices of beer.  Oh, if only they had a selection of soda the way they had a selection of beer.  

Parking is plentiful and the grounds are always kept neat.  Folks who work there have all been helpful and friendly.  It may feel like it's forever away from our Phoenix core, but it's not to far for an experience that BOB or Chase Field could never provide.",0
This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.,0
Excellent burger,0
Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..,0
"I was actually really impressed, even though I didn't think I would be.  I headed here for lunch last week when Chipotle was super busy.

They have a great and fairly affordable lunch menu with lots of options, including lots of vegetarian options.  I also really appreciated that my waitress went back and checked with a vegetarian staff member to see if the tomato soup had meat stock (it didn't, but minestrone did).

I got the pasta with the soup or salad combo with this delicious Mediterranean pasta - olive oil, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes and red peppers.  The pasta itself was surprisingly bland, but with a hint of salt and pepper, it was pretty tasty.  The bread that it came with was also delicious, all on its own.  I got the tomato soup, and man, it was definitely one of the better tomato soups I've been lucky enough to have.

My server was great about the food coming out quickly, and was on top of my refills.  Very friendly, not over-crowding.

I'll be back in the future with my partner to get a better feel for the beer (which I don't drink) and meat dishes (which I don't eat), but I'm happy with my first visit and will be back!",0
"I found this place in Yelp, so I at least started with some optimism ;) I wasn't disappointed. Great portions and plenty of variety. Got egg rolls, mu shu pork, house low mein,  Mongolian beef, rice and 4 fortune cookies, soy sauce, and hot
mustard for about $30 plus tip. Plenty of leftovers after stuffing myself ;)  Everything tasted as expected, though the egg rolls and Mongolian beef were better than most... Not crazy great, but really good for take out/delivery. Now if they only made Chinese turkey for Christmas!!",0
"I have found my new favorite breaksfast/lunch spot! I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery. We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread. We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case. 

My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.

It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more.",0
"I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips.",0
"Congratulations on opening the Gilbert location. Glad to see you guys making the shift to the far East Valley. As to be expected, the bruschetta was great. We really enjoyed the Syrah and the Sangiovese. It's really hard to beat the $5 glass/pitcher deal before 5pm, and the board + bottle ($20) on Monday and Tuesday night make for the perfect date night, though it can prove to create a long wait.

It was nice to see staff from the other locations making the move out here. Small mishaps and things that get confused in the midst of opening a new restaurant are bound to happen. No worries though, we've been 5 times in the first 10 days, showing that you guys are right on target. Looking forward to getting to know the staff and becoming weekly regulars.",0
"Terrible food. Pretentious service. Stale bread brought to table. Mole was grainy and tasteless. On the upside, great tequila selection! At least you can get loaded and pretend the dinner you just waited too long for and paid too much for was worth it.",0
"This place loses out due to poor customer service, which is a shame, because the food is good.  it didn't used to always be this way.  It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management. 

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged.",0
"I love German food, and as far as the food went at Bavarian Point, they had some good eats. The *only* reason I'm giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food. Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying ""seat yourself"". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say. It's too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me.",0
"One of my earliest memories of Phoenix concerns waking up under the eucalyptus trees that used to cover most of what is now the business park and shopping center next to what I will call the ""new"" Duck. The old one was far larger and would have been about where the Starbucks is now. Of course, I'm talking about 1973 here, so I digress. . . .

Anyway, the current abbreviated Duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in Phoenix. Now I have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place. The bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass. Most nights the by-the-glass happy hour special is something rather interesting, in contrast to the ""red"" or ""white' found in other joints. The interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar. In fact, you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the Duck.

And the sandwiches! Yes, try them all. Very, very good.",0
"I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.",0
"Our group was not pleased with the quality of  the seared tuna salad (everything about it was low quality and just not tasty) and the quality of the grilled cheese (Velveeta cheese?) sliders.  The cuban sandwich was pretty good, though it's not enough to make us want to go back for more.  On the good side, our server was really nice and sitting outside was very pleasant and breezy.  I hope the food improves.",0
"Stayed here for a friends wedding and it was excellent.  The rooms are expensive, but they have been redone.  This hotel was built in the 80's and the grounds are above par.  They have a 3 level pool with a bar in the middle.  Works for me!  The golf course is  really nice.

The staff is excellent and the rooms were really nice.  Make sure to use your Starwood Guest Number. If you like cactus, stay here.",0
"Being a stranger to town, it took a while to find it, but well worth the search.  I was hungry for cajun food and thought I would give it a try, and am glad I did.  I tried both the gumbo and jambalaya and both were excellent.  I sat at the bar, and the service was friendly and attentive. Although it is a long drive, I will be going back as soon as I have another craving for cajun food.",0
"Very nice, classy decor all around, cleaner than most places I've seen. Seems like a place you'd wanna dress up for.

Drinks could be a little cheaper ($9 a shot), but I figure it's Scottsdale, so whatevs..

Music ranges anywhere from old school hip hop to top 40's music you hear straight from the radio.

No cover, so that's always a plus.",0
"Great soup at a great price.

I go for the veggie soup normally, since I'm a bit leery of the raw meats and strange meatballs you can get.  Their vermicelli is also quite edible.

Service could be a little quicker.

Bring cash if you're spending less than $5 - with pho and water you will pay 3.50 + tax.  Cheapest lunch in town.",0
"This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.

My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)

Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!

We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.

Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said ""We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.""   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.

We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  

The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!",0
"Westgate has a few more restaurants now but stil need more shops for shopping to come along.  It is starting to build up but slowly.  It was nice to walk around from dinner, but the amount of teenage kids there were a little annoying.  Guess I am not the mommy type!",0
Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.,0
"Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).  

Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday!

I've never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi.

Recommendations:
Signature Roll
Squid Salad
Yellowtail Collarbone
Drinks, Drinks...drinks.

They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well.

1 Thing: When it's busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting.",0
I believe this place is over-hyped.  the menu is overpriced.  the portions are small.  the meat is low quality.  slow service.  sterile decor.,0
"This place is sweet. They are not big on china, glassware or silverware. They use recycled products plates, plastic-ware and drinks in the container they come in (ie a coke in a coke can). The ambiance is awesome. Sweet and funny signs everywhere, reading material, classic rock playing. They only have the radio on but there always seem to be great songs on! They have a large patio out back that is difficult to see from the front but is really nice on a sunny morning. 

I haven't gotten past the breakfast bowls yet. $6 for 6 toppings, potatoes, buttered toast, and jam. Go ahead and eat carnivore, omnivore or herbivore style (not sure if there are vegan options). Seriously, this $6 breakfast bowl would be $12 at other places served on fine china and with silverware! I don't care about accoutrements like that. Especially when the food is so tasty.

The location, midway point of the Melrose District, is stellar. You can spend hours walking up and down looking at retro shops and cool little places. Two Hippies sets a perfect tone for hanging out on 7th Ave!",0
This is a great staple of Tempe.  I try to stop by here before spring training and Diamondback games.  If you're looking for a grill dog I would say this is the place to go.,0
"This is about a 3.5 star mexican place to me. I've always had good service but watched other folks get like 1-star service, at a level I might not come back.

I like the White Chimichanga here. The Chili Verde is decent, and the Hatch Chilis are nice too, if you haven't had those.

4 Stars - White Chimi
3 Stars - Chili Verde
3 Stars - Cheese crips with Hatch chilis

I'm sure there are better places around but I've been coming here for several years when in the area, and I definitely enjoy this place.

Sometimes they have hot chicks working up front. If you keep up this practice Arriba, I'll five-star you sometime soon!",0
"I've rented from Captain Ted many times, and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River. He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here.",0
"Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now. 

     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.

     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. 

     Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  
Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!",0
"Being a fan of the infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach, I was totally down for some chicken and waffles this morning. The bestie found this place because it was close to my new home in Arizona and was sure to be a hearty brekky after all the physical exertion of packing, moving and loading/unloading a Uhaul. So off we went...

The place is easy to find and pleasant to walk into. The staff was friendly immediately upon arrival. Service was quick and attentive. The menu is simple but appealing...so are the prices. We decided to go with the traditional chicken and waffle plates to satisfy the savory and sweet tooth. Waffles are big, maple syrup is warm and the chicken is perfectly southern fried. 

I'm afraid I have to admit that I may now be thinking of LoLo's first whenever I hear chicken and waffles. MmmMmm!",0
"not clean, worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.  No thank you.",0
"Today I was ready to be beside myself with glee as I took my daughters out for lunch. I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their ""Burger Daze"", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  

I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches. The three stars is for today only- next time I hope to come back here and give them a 5!",0
"Great cleaners, open weird hours, always polite to me, anyhoo.",0
"I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!",0
"It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana , hazelnut and lemon. It is quality stuff. If you want something better fly to Italy.",0
"Been here twice and enjoyed both of our experiences. The setting is pretty urban feeling for far east Mesa--grateful for that. The wine list is pretty unusual...lots of wines and grapes you've never heard of since the owner is from...Hungary? Can't remember, but the wine selection benefits from his extensive knowledge of that region. 

The fried chicken--patented, no less--was really something. Spicy and brined to fall off the bone. The pasta dishes are good as well, with portions expected in a urban restaurant (don't expect Claim Jumper portions). 

All in all a great place to sit, savor dinner and talk. Waitstaff is on a learning curve, and you benefit, since the restaurant is new and they bend over backwards, service-wise. Highly recommended!",0
"Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square).

I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie, you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.",0
"Bad customer service!  

No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number, phone just kept ringing and ringing.  :(",0
"What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.

$5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump.",0
"what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.  (sorry phx.) 

I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical. 

the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?) 

the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust. 

The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)

If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either. 

What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!",0
"This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.",0
"2.5 stars really. I've been holding off on the review because I stunned myself by paying $6.50 for a macaroon. Really? I did that! Ugh. It was tasty but $6.50!?! 

And, that's not even counting my breakfast: $9 for a wedge of quiche and a salad (that I didn't want - I just wanted a piece of quiche). 

I don't mind paying for good food (anyone who knows me knows food is pretty much WHAT I spend my money on... ) but I'm having huge buyer's remorse... over my meal! Something's not right with that.",0
"CASH ONLY!  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.  So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.",0
"Nice place surrounded by many fast food places. No grease here!  Breads are wonderful, but customer service was just ok.  Great pastries and part of the Belly loyalty program.  Super dog friendly as well with the outdoor seating.",0
"I got the banana nutella cupcake and love the banana bread-like cupcake. However, the frosting is way too sweet and overpowers the banana flavor of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity. 
With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here.",0
"Good water pressure.  $2 = 6 min. Cons- ""water pressure gun"" rubber tips come OFF -can scratch car paint. Had to back out since a car blocked me forward-then a hose (which I put back) caught my car. Hispanc guy gets angry/curses. The ceiling 360 degress brush holder gets jammed. 1 is bent. Stalls get muddy.  Vacuums not strong.",0
"Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for a milkshake when my sister was visiting from out of town. We browsed the racks of vintage clothing and costume jewelry before sitting down at the bar. It was difficult to choose our milkshake flavor, given the dizzying array of syrups and ice cream combos, but after settling on chocolate and wild cherry, we were very pleased. Plus it was a cheerful looking thing, topped with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, and a cherry.
I was not as pleased with the service... it wasn't busy until after we sat down, but no one took our order or even gave us a menu or a ""hello"" until we'd been sitting for about 10 minutes. A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait. While we waited, I did enjoy looking at all the cool decor from the past, though I think the whole place could be a little bit cleaner.",0
"Had a late night plumbing emergency last night. Called a friend who recommended Kevin's Classic Plumbing. Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem. At 10:00pm my water was back on with kids taking showers, toilets being flushed, and my wife was talking to me again. Sounds great right? Get's even better! The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever. Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy. Kevin's Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on.

On another note... I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long. They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew. Thanks Parker & Son's.",0
I always just get one thing from Vietnamese places and its their rice dish with grilled pork chop and egg cake. This place does it goooood. You get a reasonable amount for the price and the fish sauce is just right.,0
"I've really tried to like the Gilbert House. Been there several times; unfortunately, I've always left underwhelmed. The coffee isn't very good. The dishes are unique, but lack taste. I ordered a spinach and goat cheese quiche last Sunday. The quiche was cool (expected it to be a bit warmer) and only had a hint of spinach. Not what I expected.  Prices are ok, but there are so many good independent restaurants in the area, that there is just no good excuse for bad food",0

"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!",0
"This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!",0
"After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal, but wasn't as impressed with the chicken. I'll have to go back to see if it was a fluke.",0
"Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin' good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like ""Hello Kitty,"" ""Harajuku Lover,"" ""Shiso Horny,"" and ""Kinki Kooler"" just to name a few. My favorite was the ""Turning Japanese"" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear.

Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.

In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with ""entertainment"" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? You'll want to take your business there on a daily basis.",0
"Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale ""clubber"" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling).

The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%",0
"Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. 

After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The ""quinoa crust"" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.

We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made ""extra spicy"" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.",0
"I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.

I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...

The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.

The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.

There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.

There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.

A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.

Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. 

Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.

There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. 

I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.

Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs.

these guides on your computer s hard disk as other people will be ordering these guides from you paying you for them and you will need to email the guides to the new buyers step NUMBER from the list of names above delete the name and address of the person shown under guide NUMBER and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from guide NUMBER s slot be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown check the address again step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with your own name and address this step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders

names on the list with the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends that might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people but that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit what will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new buyers if the people you slip into that list aren t going to be sending new emails you re only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted there wouldn t be new buyers coming in so your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero furthermore if you have done the work and your name has worked its way to further down the list by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason don t do it to others remember honesty reaps the reward you may have a concern that after sending the total NUMBER to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money and not send you the guide well rest assured as we said above it s to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers so don t think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to stiff you for NUMBER NUMBER the people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you later on when other buyers send you the order to buy the guides fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered guide to the buyer don t cheat provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit end of summary rest of message with easy to use email tools and opt in email success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before and the earnings potential is staggering read this email to the end follow what it says and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for yes i know what you are thinking i never responded to one of

the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address in return when

buyers will buy from you this is no different than customer service in the retail or the bricks and mortars business available guides the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each guide by its number name only always send a single NUMBER bill u s currency for each guide checks not accepted make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least NUMBER sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the guide you are ordering your email address and your name and postal address be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope place your order for these guides now from the name and address list shown at the beginning of this email ________________________________________________ your success guidelines if you do not receive at least NUMBER orders for guide NUMBER within NUMBER weeks continue sending emails until you do two to three weeks after you receive NUMBER orders you should receive NUMBER orders or more for guide NUMBER if not continue advertising or sending emails until you do once you have received NUMBER or more orders for guide NUMBER you can see the program is working and cash should continue coming in this is important to remember continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails you can keep track of progress by

found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the

really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did

plan below said it would give it a try you will be glad you did thanks and good luck you won t need luck just keep reading don t delete this first read about how a NUMBER year old made NUMBER NUMBER see below as seen on national tv this is the media report parents of NUMBER year old find NUMBER NUMBER cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her NUMBER year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labeled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past NUMBER months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever NUMBER year old the e mail letter listed NUMBER addresses and contained instructions to send one NUMBER dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within NUMBER weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing NUMBER bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had NUMBER magazine and about NUMBER envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER sections NUMBER and NUMBER which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received

marshallese name for wake island claiming to represent the mid pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france presse the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation a honolulu based attorney created the kingdom of enenkio in the early NUMBERs it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed URL disconnected as of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER the purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the kingdom of enenkio while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the kingdom of enenkio i am aghast at how distorted erroneous and misleading the article is as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio i am obligated to respond to incidents such as this i will respectfully offer the following line by line correction for your convenience your text will be set off with in color dom is located on karitane island and now includes the taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the south pacific NUMBER miles south of tahiti comment the construction of this statement implies the marshall islands are in the south pacific ocean NUMBER miles south of tahiti in which case a reader may be misled correction dom is located on karitane island in the south pacific NUMBER miles south of tahiti and now includes taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the north pacific however the marshall islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations comment just because the rmi government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of enenkio does that make it true why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized and documented time and again for fraud abuse of human rights outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made what purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government namely the dom and sister nation the kingdom of enenkio the marshallese name for wake island comment nothing could be further from the truth we cannot speak for dom but as for the kingdom we don t even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign his majesty king remios the sovereign of enenkio and eneen kio atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore correction the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for dom claiming to represent the mid pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france presse comment the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people of enenkio who are forced to live in exile from eneen kio atoll lands and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for perhaps NUMBER years furthermore an article in agence france presse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands government my preceding comments apply the kingdom of enenkio is not now and never has been engaged in an investment scam we have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio but also will positively impact people around the globe in fact we are currently working with a former nasa astronaut one tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation comment the kingdom of enenkio has made no fraudulent claims of which i am aware and in my post i am responsible for all published information i would personally caution any countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of nations companies or publications if i had credible proof to that effect however my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any rmi ministry source furthermore the rmi has repeatedly attacked the credibility of his majesty king hermios who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over NUMBER NUMBER of the land in the marshall islands including recent attempts to sequester him against his will we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till to perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism a honolulu based attorney created the kingdom of enenkio in the early NUMBERs comment mr moore is not an attorney though he was living in honolulu in the early NUMBERs correction the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the owner of eneen kio atoll a k a enen kio halcyon disclerta wake and NUMBER NUMBER other names iroijlaplap murjel hermios who then was paramount chief of the northern ratak atolls he passed away in december NUMBER and was fully recognized by the rmi government he declared the sovereign state of enenkio in NUMBER whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen kio atoll ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel sic hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf correction the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made possible by murjel s appointment of mr robert moore the adopted brother of hermios alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen to the post of minister plenipotentiary the document of appointment was also a special power of attorney which granted mr moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from eneen kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios and the people s behalf the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed comment since when is a special power of attorney an agreement the marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special power of attorney except as has been publicized by the kingdom of enenkio and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen kio atoll which lies over NUMBER miles north of lawful rmi boundaries the rmi has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen kio atoll because the atoll by any name you choose was not incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in NUMBER nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act law mandate or otherwise of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen kio and any statement to the contrary is false fraudulent and irresponsible finally i suggest you as a journalist or publisher do a little more research not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio but into the prehistoric history and more recent u s invasion of eneen kio atoll properly named by marshallese centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above all of which exist in hard copy not in cyberspace and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show in many cases full color digitized letters of correspondence with the NUMBER or so states in the world many of which are first world in closing i would

cited above in the article skip to next file top of page june NUMBER NUMBER sir the following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the kingdom of enenkio thank you for spelling enenkio

fantasy island disconnected as of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER response to the author i am unable to locate the melchizedek press release you cited indicating that taongi was leased in NUMBER under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of enenkio such an act would be impossible and implausible as enenkio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over taongi atoll in the marshall islands further more melchizedek dom is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the NUMBERth day of september NUMBER but it did not convey a lease of land it declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments however a prior agreement signed in may NUMBER which had nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio transferred mr robert moore s rights to develop taongi from mr moore to dom it did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence this was made possible because mr moore is the alab one class of landowner of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to taongi atoll from the principal landowner iroijlaplap paramount chief murjel hermios who was aware of and supported the transaction consideration if any under the agreement was personally retained by mr moore who is also the adopted brother of hermios now please understand that while mr moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf and that of the future use and development of taongi which would have generated an income to iroijlaplap hermios mr moore wears another hat as minister plenipotentiary of the kingdom of enenkio iroijlaplap hermios also wore he died in december NUMBER NUMBER the same date of your article other hats one as first monarch king of the kingdom of enenkio and one as owner in allodium of eneen kio atoll a k a enen kio halcyon disclerta wake and several other names for you to state the kingdom of enenkio is another only in cyberspace country as you did in the above article is not only a completely and categorically false statement but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio and it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon his majesty king hermios the sovereign of enenkio and eneen kio atoll and an inexplicable and

government admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism appears to have violated the laws of nature and the law of nations in taking possession of sovereign property in the northern ratak state which

sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many marshallese because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation these scars on marshallese society have not healed thus a current state of adversity exists following four years of attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to wake island the government of enenkio on behalf of the marshallese king issued the state of war a declaration and broadcast it to the world the people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war not by virtue of being kept in but by virtue of being kept out it was through this pragmatic initiative that the kingdom of enenkio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the ratak paramount chief king murjel hermios in retrospect the declaration has had little visible effect while a state of adversity does exist the hope for american recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon the kingdom of enenkio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations the kingdom of enenkio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the marshallese people while the kingdom of enenkio continues to seek accountability of the u s congress to obey its own laws to conform to the un charter conventions of the united nations relating to self determination preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses it believes accountability requires the u s to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity the refusal of the u s to meet its obligations even to the extent that a simple

reveal that the multiple landings by united states warships en route to the philippines on war missions and subsequent congressional action were the sole basis of the u s claim the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the east such a station was never established at wake island it was destined to become a military installation however formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u s president by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of correspondence followed but since the u s abandoned

continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership upon the basis of events and actions by the united states the administration of the kingdom of enenkio by virtue of the

marshallese civilization and for at least NUMBER years prior to the NUMBER fiasco note these facts and validity of the hermios claim are a matter of historical record not a fabrication NUMBER investigate and or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and u s policy past and present or the lack thereof with regard to the role of enenkio note it is my understanding wake was decommissioned after the so called processing of thousands of south vietnamese refugees in the late NUMBERs NUMBER reflect on the contrasting history of u s occupation war technological advances in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind NUMBER respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king s claim of allodial title the declaration of rights of the citizens of enenkio to self determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner NUMBER bring to light u s strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation offensive defensive weapon systems clandestine military research environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there note congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of wake island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects NUMBER fully disclose to the people of the united states u s strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to eneen kio atoll by king hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time honored and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions disregard for human rights protected under international law united nations charter and conventions and the u s compact with the marshall islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century note u s apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year and the return of the hawaiian island kaho olawe also of religious significance has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio citizens parting shot what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general the u s federal government more precisely which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe but considering its present source it is downright alarming it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years letters reports forms published articles press releases legal notices documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have escaped official response from officers of the u s federal government our not too distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western civilized nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of manifest destiny which clearly marked american foreign policy of a century ago if this current trend signifies a resurgence it can only be considered a giant leap backward considering the flimsy record of american attempts at fixing up the world the title of ownership and inheritance of eneen kio atoll pre dates formation of the united states by two centuries or more it is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor people have a right to know the media a responsibility to show them in conclusion i reiterate that our focus from my point of view is one not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u s political philosophy and military prowess but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past supporting restoration of human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of god given individual rights thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry top of page november NUMBER NUMBER news release in a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include wake island site of a u s military outpost his majesty king murjel hermios through his legal representative minister plenipotentiary robert moore the u s

 welcome to ghetto america yes you heard me i said ghetto america what is ghetto america i m glad you asked before i go on please be warned this explanation may not sit well with many of you however it is no less true ghetto america is a society of individuals comprised primarily of african americans who represent the impoverished and often unpolished side of black america confused i shall explain further have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community namely the projects and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood and wondered how could that be or maybe you have been to a shopping mall and noticed an unusual amount of young teen looking black women carrying infants or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them if you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important wedding band missing from their respective ring fingers and of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns and knives allegedly mugging robbing and carjacking people of all sorts did you know that many young african american women refuse to date african american males if they do not own or possess an automobile in fact many young black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society commonly known as thugs or street hustlers also did you know that many young african american males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing better known as the projects rather than move away purchase new homes save or even make investments attention this is not another boyz in the hood story these newly distinguished black generation xers are suffering through utter chaos baby makers loser choosers welfare abusers images of my america is a collection of observations and commentary as told through the eyes of a young african american male who experienced and perpetuated many of the truths that many in black america and the world in general would have you believe do not exist it is a riveting expose that sheds light on the oppressive and often discriminatory nature of mainstream american society a society that has nurtured the rampant disregards for self respect and enlightenment that many young african american men and women currently suffer from the writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to raise children with many being teens themselves and the foolish criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates oftentimes being based on nothing more than the young black male s tough or cool neighborhood reputation the author also identifies the self destructive and often criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily basis like refusing to pursue higher education carrying guns robbing stealing selling drugs driving fancy cars and wearing expensive jewelry the negative and self debasing behavior committed by both males and females is due in large part to a lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless homes these poor choices and behavioral disorders coupled with the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in the form of welfare abuse and over crowded prison populations are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty and lack of direction that currently exists in young black america today to learn more about this dynamic self contained society visit URL and reserve your copy today to request an excerpt please email books URL buy this soon to be best seller now URL ,1

 foreword after thirty three years of being a black man living in ghetto america an environment notorious for danger crime and poverty i have made startling discoveries involving young african american men and women who comprise what i have come to define as the black generation x i have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young african americans from the general definition of generation x aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed baby boomers it s important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young african american culture i have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth childhood and young adult life taken from a web site entitled generation x created and maintained by the colorado college the definition is as follows we are a group of people born between NUMBER and NUMBER we are individuals who live for the here and now like to experiment and who require immediate results we are typically selfish and cynical and depend a lot on our parents we question authority and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations it s that simple it seems we have come to be called xer s simply because we represent something negative to our elders we may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings of course they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility or actually their fault our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse we are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school it appears we have little hope for the future no jobs no homes and basically no money are almost expected of us these bleak prospects along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever do not provide much hope some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood as our saviors we will soon discover who is right and who is wrong this definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that generation x is comprised of one core group of american citizens it over generalizes the similarities it expresses and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years when in fact these similarities speak primarily to only white issues and concerns for instance they say we depend a lot on our parents but in ghetto america we could only depend on one our mothers they also say we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations and we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever in ghetto america no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now and is all we have time for i have known for many years that the differences that separate generation xer s black and white occupants would eventually be identified i never knew i would be the one doing it extracting the black from generation x and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency without doing so the social ills that plague ghetto america would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective american identity there are many hidden truths that exist in black america today white america charges that we spend our time collecting welfare refusing to vote reading elementary styled books watching music videos day dreaming of becoming rappers basketball players selling drugs and making babies much of this is supported in marlon riggs s documentary entitled ethnic notions when african americans are mentioned whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book a reality that i confirmed while watching roger me another documentary written and directed by michael moore sadly many of us have begun to validate this skewed image while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for b e t black entertainment television many of us fail to realize that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal should be taken as an opportunity to improve empower enlighten and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior regarding black women i have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities i began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole that black men owed them something and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives be it emotional physical or economical normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended in most cases it has not been it s funny though looking back i am surprised i never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to or the various schools of thought they possessed many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the african american male some fair and some unfair much of what the public believes and understands about the black female s social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is what originally sparked my attention was an observation i stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction i noticed virtually all of the books i read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent african american perspective these stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all african americans thrive on a middle to upper class professional level they relay stories of relationship problems with huxtable like bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love as i read these stories i couldn t help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or working class african americans although there are those in the black community that can identify with the huxtable like dynamic unfortunately they are few and far between the majority of stories i have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued black america the black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our dirty laundry the fact is truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind i recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal as our discussion intensified i reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed and oftentimes not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself the purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self destructive thinking and self imprisoning behavior that black male and female generation x have been subscribing to while discussing this with my friend she suggested i simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what i m attempting to convey acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood i suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative to grab a dictionary don t feel bad there were several times i had to as well regarding black men an overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool buying sports wear driving expensive cars wearing gold or platinum jewelry and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions i have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of african american culture because i have lived it i have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level it is a world of ignorance selfishness pre occupation and idiocy in my world there are people who applaud a lack of education who brag about having served time in u s penitentiaries the types of guns they carry dope peddling and chasing women they champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit in this world wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they ve got a million it s a world where children dress in over priced sports wear mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye thinking such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one s self worth and the possible corruption this thinking breeds seems to not be an important concern for black mothers it may come as a shock to know that most african americans feel that those who don t have the same if not better material possessions are lesser beings referring to them as being corny lame or broke even our male rapper entertainers promote backward priorities nothing else matters as long as you look good the big tymers a popular rap duo have a song called i m still fly shown in heavy rotation on b e t and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country fly is ghetto vernacular for well dressed also used to describe a female s beauty its signature verse asserts i got gator boots with a pimped out gucci suit can t pay my rent cause all my money s spent but that s o k cause i m still fly worse yet in the song grinding the popular duo eclipse glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video the term grinding is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs the fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on b e t is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil some of the key lyrics to this song are grinding you know what i keep in the lining the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs and patty cake patty cake i m the bakers man i bake them cakes as fast as i can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and i disguise it as rap so the feds backup in this verse the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack when created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake hence the term cake or sometimes pie unfortunately for the rap genre this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law the negative references i ve identified have become an integral part of the urban african american existence this mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable this ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has there is an overwhelming part of the african american community that is aware of this crippling mentality there are also many that are unaware and unfortunately more that do not even care those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily whether because of habit or misguided values this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance it should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us we must save ourselves i am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now and are thinking what right do i have to express the opinions i have thus far as well as those i have al luded too i have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content there is far too much negativity thriving within our culture there must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth whether good or bad i am aware that not all of us have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community and i have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life any similarities and generalizations i illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified additionally throughout this book i will refer to african americans in four different ways the first being african americans denoting our status as citizens in the united states secondly as black a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country third as niggas a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with nigger the term nigga has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship hence the term my nigga as well as a blanket reference when speaking to of or about other black males in a non personal manner i felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences i will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place and fourth as ghetto this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the less polished members of our community it is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such my commentary is based on real life situations both good and bad and how one african american man was affected by them to that end i feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals i have encountered despite the negativity they have displayed i only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to in many ways has caused them to become their own worst enemy in the case of the black female s negative and limited perspective toward black men the world and subconsciously themselves i submit that this mentality is perhaps single handedly responsible for the lack of success happiness and quality of life that is at the center of every african american woman s fantasy quest it is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men has been deliberately created by white america for example much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day many past issues have taken on new identities and have re emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men the resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate america without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design there are other core issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation such as color barriers light skin versus dark skin good hair versus bad hair loyalty devotion and economic status believe it or not there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn t sell drugs or was not thugged out a term for being rough or hoodlum like the reasoning behind it being that the thug and drug dealer lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence these issues among others relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society sadly that confused mentality is responsible for much of the neglect the african american ghetto community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren who have locked it away in the basement and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ghetto america does not exist furthermore the lack of acknowledgement of which i speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the african american community their plight is a well known reality but in many cases much of ghetto america falls under that same umbrella be advised this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into black america rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young african americans including myself have come to perpetuate moreover that backward thinking is the main cause of our inability to strive for a common goal an outcome that must be met and can only be met with godly faith positive strategy cooperation love loyalty self and

hi i m a college dropout i work about two hours a day i m ambitious but extremely lazy and i make over NUMBER NUMBER a year are you curious yet in a minute i m going to tell you my secret it s the dirty little secret of the internet you ve probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online but you thought they were the big corporate execs famous programmers or boy geniuses well grasshopper think again it s people like you and me that are making the real money yep people like you and me ever since the dot com bubble burst in NUMBER small time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the fortune NUMBER companies look for bankruptcy lawyers today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with no investment and very little work how by learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created it s called bulk email if you ve ever recieved an email advertisement then you know what bulk email is i bet you can t click on delete fast enough for most of those ads right you might not want their product but remember that thousands of other folks probably do bulk email is a percentage game every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the internet i guarantee it now let s go back to math NUMBER and review some numbers if you sell on ebay you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction how many people see your ad maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days using bulk email you can send your ad to more than a million people a day at virtually no cost whether your send NUMBER NUMBER emails or NUMBER million emails the price is the same zero stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of NUMBER NUMBER on each sale if you send an email ad to NUMBER NUMBER people and only one person in a thousand actually places an order then you just generated NUMBER orders and made NUMBER NUMBER in a few hours of work it s that simple all you have to do is convince one person out of a thousand to buy your stuff and you re filthy rich the best thing is that anyone can do it doesn t matter if you re a nineteen year old college student using a dorm room computer or a fifty year old executive working from an office building in new york city anyone and i repeat anyone can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs all it takes is a few days of study plenty of ambition and some basic familiarity with the internet i quit college when i was NUMBER to capitalize on the dot com mania and i ve never looked back i started with no money no product to sell and only the most rudimentary computer skills i saw an opportunity and i seized it a few years later i bought my own home with cash you don t need any money you don t need a product you don t need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required if you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you d jump right on it it would be a dream come true so what are you waiting for i m going to ask you four simple
